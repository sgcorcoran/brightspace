00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
all right welcome to part three of

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,160
chapter four

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,200
defects and imperfections in crystalline

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,360
solids

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,559
we talked last time about the

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,360
two-dimensional

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,080
or line defects the only type of line

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,640
defect we have or dislocations

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,039
screw and edge okay they're related to

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,560
mechanical behavior

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,119
and then before that we looked at point

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,840
defects these are one-dimensional type

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,840
defects

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,199
maybe missing atoms or atoms in

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,160
locations between the host

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,000
atoms those are called interstices and

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,399
we can't refer to these as interstitial

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,399
sites

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,960
all right now we're going to see also

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,079
these point defects are going to be

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,640
related

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,440
to processing of materials i didn't

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,480
mention that before

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,800
so now we're going to go ahead and do

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,640
the interfacial or 3d defects

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,079
these are the highest energy defects

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
that we have

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,800
because now we're looking at large

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,280
collections of atoms across the surface

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,080
or between two grains or two phases

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,080
in a material

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,880
so what i've got here is a fairly old

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,320
image of a bubble raft again these

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,200
bubble wraps really work

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,000
well to show these kinds of concepts but

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,880
i have these

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,119
this bubble raft and when this bubble

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,159
raft

39
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,400
was developed again we've got the

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,759
uh hexagonal pattern here which

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,920
resembles

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,280
like a one one one surface and face

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,520
centered cubic

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,840
okay so we're just looking at a plane of

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,840
bubbles or

46
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,439
atoms refer to these as atoms now

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,479
and each of these regions where this

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,920
uh particular crystal structure is

49
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,240
occurring is a grain

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,240
or a crystal because this is a single

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,680
crystal i refer to them as greens now

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,600
when they're in a material

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
so there's a single crystal or green

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,719
there's another green another green at

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,799
the bottom

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,320
all right so if i was to sort of draw

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,319
lines here along

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,280
the the atoms in my material i can draw

59
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,080
lines

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,599
along the atoms here in this other grain

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,680
you can see the angle

62
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,120
difference between the two greens so

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,480
these two grains

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,319
are twisted relative to each other

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,160
and this is a fairly large angle of

66
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,360
difference and you can see that when

67
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,520
they come together

68
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,400
at the boundary there's a lot of

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,840
distortion

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,879
and a lot of extra space so this is all

71
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,800
the space

72
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,640
and distortion between these greens this

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
is a high angle boundary

74
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,000
so this particular boundary is going to

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
have the

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,239
higher energy as compared to the low

77
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,440
angle boundary that doesn't have

78
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,840
as much distortion again now this is

79
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,959
a 2d picture so this looks like a line

80
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,599
remember

81
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,080
this is occurring in 3d right these

82
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,440
grains here are in 3d and so

83
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,120
this is really an entire surface between

84
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,840
these grains

85
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,560
that we're talking about all right so

86
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,800
over here

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,640
you can see that the grain boundary

88
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,599
between these two

89
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,120
actually looks pretty good in spots

90
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,800
right

91
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,879
and you can see that the angle

92
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
difference between them is relatively

93
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,159
small

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and so there's some agreement every so

95
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,640
often in fact

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,159
much of what is in here are basically

97
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,599
dislocations

98
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,400
so it ends up looking like kind of a row

99
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,080
of dislocations along this boundary to

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,920
make up for this

101
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,640
small misfit between these two grains

102
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,280
that's our low angle grain boundary and

103
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,840
it's going to have

104
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,400
lower energy than our high angle green

105
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,760
boundary

106
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
all right so i think this picture shows

107
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,239
it pretty nicely i think the one in your

108
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,319
textbook

109
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,480
uh is a little confusing because the low

110
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,640
angle boundary actually looks worse

111
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,159
than the high angle so think of this

112
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,000
kind of picture

113
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,400
now if we were to use a optical

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,159
microscope

115
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,080
and take a look at a surface after it's

116
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,920
been polished and etched

117
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,959
what the polishing and etching does is

118
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,320
polishing smoothens the surface

119
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,160
and then the etching attacks the

120
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,639
boundaries between the grains so it

121
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,320
actually eats the boundaries

122
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,800
and it does that because of the fact

123
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,600
that those boundaries have high energy

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,639
and so the corrosion or the etching due

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,639
to the

126
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,680
chemical that's put on here the acids

127
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,160
typically

128
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,040
are going to actually eat away at the

129
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,199
boundaries

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,320
so this is done relatively quickly not

131
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,880
for very long

132
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
just enough to put a groove in between

133
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,400
two

134
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,560
grains at the boundary then when you put

135
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,479
an optical microscope on it most of the

136
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,000
light reflects back nicely

137
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,720
but when it hits these boundaries it

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,560
reflects off and these will look dark

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,080
so here's a optical micrograph of an

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,840
iron chrome alloy

141
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,400
and anything i want you just to notice

142
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,919
here is the green boundaries

143
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,919
so this is referred to as a

144
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,360
polycrystalline sample

145
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,800
where it's got multiple crystals

146
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,800
and also called greens

147
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,000
so one of the things that we would like

148
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,479
to be able to do

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,759
is say something about the size of these

150
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,720
grains

151
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,360
so we could just measure diameter and

152
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,560
report that but what has been done is

153
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,039
something called a grain size number i

154
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,880
should

155
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,240
mention the reason why we want to put a

156
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,160
number on these

157
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,680
is that we will also find in the

158
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,440
strengthening chapter believe the

159
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,800
smaller they get

160
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,919
the higher strength the material has so

161
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,759
again this is a structure this on

162
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,800
the micro scale so we're looking at

163
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,280
grains

164
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,880
if we change their size they change the

165
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,479
mechanical behavior

166
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,479
of this particular material

167
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,960
so we'd like some way to characterize

168
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,520
the grain size number

169
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,680
this is g the grain size number varying

170
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,479
from 1 to 10

171
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,479
10 being very small grains so what you

172
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,759
do is basically take a

173
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,960
optical micrograph and then you count

174
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,240
the number of grains per inch squared so

175
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,560
you can physically

176
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,400
put an inch squared on the micrograph

177
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,160
count the number of grains in it

178
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,440
move your inch squared count again until

179
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,800
you get some a decent number for this

180
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,880
now we have it in the computer and of

181
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,919
course we can we can automate all of

182
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,440
this

183
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,440
but this is the way that it was done is

184
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,120
the way it was defined in our

185
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,440
optical micrograph that we would have

186
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,319
would be at 100x

187
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,280
so the grain size number is defined as

188
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,479
the greens

189
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,680
per inch squared 100x okay so

190
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:53,120
n here is the number of grains

191
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,639
per n squared at 100x we divide by the

192
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
log of two

193
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,599
add one and this gives us our green size

194
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,599
number

195
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,240
so many times what will happen is you'll

196
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,240
go ahead and count grains per inch

197
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,560
squared but your photograph

198
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,360
is at a different magnification so maybe

199
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,199
it was taken at 85x

200
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,960
but we still need this grain size number

201
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,880
and so we have to fix

202
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,840
the fact that our area that we're

203
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,720
looking at is different

204
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,400
if i have a lower magnification that i'm

205
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,000
going to be counting more grains than

206
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,639
should be there

207
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,080
right so the higher magnification i'm

208
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,720
i'm zooming into the sample

209
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,120
if you want and so an inch squared would

210
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,599
see

211
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,639
less grains so that's important for just

212
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,560
remembering

213
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,280
uh in terms of the correction which way

214
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,080
to go okay so i'm going to see a lower

215
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,479
number

216
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,080
so what i'm going to do is divide 85 by

217
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,440
100

218
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,800
and since this is an area not a linear

219
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,199
but an area

220
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
then i've got a square so my difference

221
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,160
would be the square

222
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,120
of 85 divided by 100. so i go ahead and

223
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,560
do that

224
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,360
multiply this 62.6 and it tells me i

225
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,759
should read

226
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
something like 45.2 grains for each

227
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,680
squared 100x

228
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,840
and then i can put that into my formula

229
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
and get my grain size number out at 6.5

230
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,360
all right so we got a way of

231
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,599
characterizing grain sizes

232
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,039
let's talk about different kinds of of

233
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,919
green boundaries so we

234
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,440
we talked about the high angle low angle

235
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,800
and then there's a special type called a

236
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,199
twin boundary

237
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,200
which has an even lower energy than the

238
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,360
low angle boundary

239
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,760
this twin boundary has a special

240
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,039
relationship

241
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,599
between the in the two grains in terms

242
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,160
of their

243
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:49,600
angle their angle of twist here

244
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,360
and so angle rotation so if you were to

245
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,640
take a crystal structure like this one

246
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,959
for example

247
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,920
this was the plane that was exposed you

248
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,440
can see that

249
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,760
if i match this special angle here

250
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
i can get there to be perfect alignment

251
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,640
along the grain boundary

252
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,720
they're all sharing this center atom the

253
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,600
distance from this corner

254
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,640
to that corner is the same so i'm

255
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,880
actually don't have any extra space here

256
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,640
now the symmetry is different i know

257
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,519
i'll have more like a kite

258
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,000
than i do a rectangle and so there is a

259
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,120
higher

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,720
energy here versus having no boundary at

261
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,720
all

262
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,640
but it's not bad and it's much lower

263
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,959
than the low angle boundary

264
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,080
so this is actually not a bubble raft up

265
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,560
here but this is a tm micrograph

266
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,320
at atomic resolution and you can see

267
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,279
this twin boundary here

268
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,560
and you can see these atoms and then the

269
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,120
slight

270
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,839
tilt off so this is like a mirror plane

271
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,040
if you want

272
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,480
these are mirrored these two if you were

273
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,200
to take an optical micrograph

274
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,480
something that has twins in it because

275
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,959
the

276
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,120
original grain let's take a look at say

277
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,959
this this is a grain boundary that's in

278
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,600
here

279
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:10,800
so these are all uh originally greens

280
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,000
and these greens

281
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,640
looks like maybe there's a line through

282
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,399
here or something these grains

283
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,160
were then distorted or stretched they

284
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,040
were deformed

285
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,360
a load was applied to them and they

286
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,640
resulted in a twinning

287
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,240
of the grain so these sharp lines here

288
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,680
represent part of the grain that was

289
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:37,120
that had undergone a a twin

290
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,959
a reorientation of the lattice

291
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,320
okay to accommodate the strain in the

292
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,839
structure

293
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,440
and so they usually show up as very

294
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,480
straight lines

295
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,040
and usually in pairs so you'll see like

296
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,880
here

297
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,440
there's a bad line here there's a twin

298
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,959
and then a pair and the reason they show

299
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,839
up in different contrast is that when

300
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,240
you

301
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,680
shift the grain like this you're by

302
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,839
moving it to a different angle and it

303
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,200
reflects the light

304
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,279
away from the camera and so it looks

305
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,000
dark and then

306
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,680
if you get it to twin back it will come

307
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,800
right back again

308
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,480
and so all of these straight lines you

309
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,600
see all throughout here

310
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,959
are all twin boundaries

311
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,440
so that's that's kind of neat you see

312
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,079
that a lot in face centered cubic

313
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,079
materials

314
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,560
all right that's our twin boundary

315
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,240
uh then we have the surface itself

316
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,240
so i can call this a lot of times we'll

317
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,600
call this the free surface

318
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,839
right but it's an interface it's an

319
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,839
interface between the solid and whatever

320
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,959
environment it's in

321
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,920
now this is the highest energy

322
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,519
so this is a higher energy than the high

323
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,600
angle grain boundary

324
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,880
think about it behind grain boundary

325
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
still has

326
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,279
atoms on the other side of the green

327
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,040
there's just a more open space

328
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,480
where the free surface now is missing

329
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,720
atoms altogether

330
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,800
so there's nothing out here but our

331
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,079
environment

332
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,600
this one's showing a complicated surface

333
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,760
just showing you that surfaces really

334
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,880
aren't just flat but there's actually

335
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,079
steps on them as we go from one plane

336
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,560
down to the parallel plane below it

337
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,240
the next parallel plane below that one

338
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,519
so you're kind of seeing that idea in

339
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,800
your textbook when you were reading

340
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,920
about

341
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,040
equivalent planes and these planes

342
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:37,360
these edges here or steps

343
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:40,320
might have missing atoms in them

344
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,240
so these are the kinks the atom could be

345
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,920
floating around on the surface by itself

346
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,240
it's an ad atom

347
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,920
uh you could have a hole in the terrace

348
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,480
so that's the vacancy it's just

349
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,760
on the surface okay this is a ledge

350
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,639
you don't need to worry about all of

351
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,079
this for our purposes

352
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,720
i mean the main thing we want to think

353
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,639
about is the fact that the surface

354
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,399
is a defect and it's higher than that

355
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,160
high energy grain boundary

356
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,920
so material really doesn't like to have

357
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,800
the surface

358
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,320
and in fact if we were to melt our

359
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,560
sample let's say this was a

360
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,360
sample of gold and we melted it it's

361
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,880
going to want to tend to form a ball

362
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,760
a sphere and that minimizes the total

363
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,760
surface area

364
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,800
all right the other thing we want to

365
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,040
know is that the

366
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,839
the surface that's exposed this plane

367
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,600
here

368
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,920
could be any of the planes in our

369
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,720
crystal this could be a one one one

370
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,120
surface

371
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,639
that could be a one zero zero surface

372
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,680
for example

373
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,760
and depending on what surface it is uh

374
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,120
what plane is showing

375
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,800
it will have a different energy and the

376
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,800
idea the basic idea here

377
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,920
concept is that the energy of the

378
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,079
surface

379
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,199
is related to the planar density of the

380
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,560
atoms

381
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,880
of this exposed plane so let me show you

382
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,079
that

383
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,920
picture form so let's say you have a

384
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:10,000
face centered cubic material

385
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,160
and i take a look at the structure of

386
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,360
two different kinds of planes

387
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,680
this is our one one one plane

388
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,920
and this one's actually a 1-1-0 plane

389
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,160
which your textbook has a

390
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:28,240
a sketch of this one i believe as well

391
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,160
so in this one the 1-1-1

392
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,639
plane here has definitely has the

393
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,959
highest density of packing right

394
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,600
the 110 plane you can see there's whole

395
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,639
missing rows of atoms

396
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,160
so when the planar when that density the

397
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:47,600
plane or density

398
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:53,199
all right is high as that

399
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,199
increases the energy

400
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,680
of this plane goes down i guess i wrote

401
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,839
that here for you

402
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:07,440
but uh so the one one one so the energy

403
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,199
of the one one one surface is less than

404
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,560
the energy

405
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,600
of the one one l okay

406
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,040
this is true for face centered cubic not

407
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,199
necessarily

408
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,199
body centered right there you'd have to

409
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,680
take a look at the planar density

410
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,040
also the planes you're interested in to

411
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,800
see which one would actually be the

412
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,920
lowest

413
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,759
all right so again though

414
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,519
even though there's different amounts of

415
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,800
surface energy

416
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,959
all of these planes would have a much

417
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,959
higher energy than a grain boundary okay

418
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,240
i'm sorry yes it's much higher energy

419
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,000
than green boundary i almost thought i

420
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,959
said that backwards

421
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,600
i just want to make you a quick chart in

422
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,639
terms of

423
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:58,000
energy so this would be

424
00:15:52,639 --> 00:16:02,320
a low energy so it doesn't cost much

425
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:06,839
to form something on the low energy end

426
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,079
in fact if we get really low like a

427
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,680
vacancy

428
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,519
we actually even have an equilibrium

429
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,360
number of them

430
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,120
i didn't mention before that when we

431
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,720
talked about the vacancy that the reason

432
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,759
why you've got

433
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,040
equilibrium number is that vacancies add

434
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,720
disorder into the structure entropy

435
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,079
so we're lowering the energy of the

436
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,199
system

437
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,519
through entropy even though it costs

438
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,680
some energy to form the vacancies

439
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,160
right up it to some point and then it

440
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,079
costs more to form the vacancies

441
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,839
at which case we've reached the

442
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,240
equilibrium number

443
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,839
all right but i've got my my vacancy my

444
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,399
point defects

445
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,360
here and i really don't want to list all

446
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,360
the point defects

447
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,959
in a particular order because it depends

448
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,000
on the material

449
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,519
but so i'm going to just put point

450
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,079
defects here

451
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,199
so those are all my one-dimensional

452
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,400
types

453
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:08,160
then my next uh increase

454
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:12,000
in energy would be my my dislocation

455
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,720
these are my 2d or line defects

456
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,400
and then i get to the 3d or surface

457
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,280
defects

458
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,720
and here we've got the i'm going to put

459
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,160
these in order for you

460
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:28,000
the twin boundary then the low

461
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:31,760
angle grain boundary

462
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,960
the high angle grain boundary

463
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,960
and then the surface

464
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,160
and so far we saw that for the face

465
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,280
centered

466
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,320
we saw that the 1 1 1

467
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,520
had the lower energy than the

468
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,919
1 1 0 for example

469
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,000
so i could kind of separate those out if

470
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,200
i want

471
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,160
all right so that is the order of my

472
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,919
different energies

473
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,200
sometimes something like this shows up

474
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,240
on a test

475
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,160
and you're asked to

476
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,440
place an order the energy or compare the

477
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,240
energy of of

478
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,760
various defects okay just in terms of

479
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,600
which one's lower or higher not in terms

480
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,600
of actual values
