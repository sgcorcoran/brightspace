1
00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.480
all right, so let's just do a quick run

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.960
through

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.400
on plotting with excel using scatter

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.480
plot

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.240
just really just for anyone who has

6
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.160
never done this before with excel so

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.199
this is a very simple

8
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.960
example i'm just going to go ahead and

9
00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.240
and take a look at this quadratic

10
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.720
formula

11
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.960
uh first thing we want to do is generate

12
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.960
some

13
00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.880
x values here so i'm going to do is

14
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.320
i'm going to go ahead and use a step of

15
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.360
0.01

16
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.399
once i get 2 entered i can then

17
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.559
highlight them both and

18
00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.800
just take this corner here and drag down

19
00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.920
as far as i need

20
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.600
it's just go ahead and just stop there

21
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.200
but that will automatically create the

22
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.559
series for me

23
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.320
i've broken the formula up into

24
00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.600
three columns and then i'm going to add

25
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.960
them all together here

26
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.879
you don't need to do this you could of

27
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.719
course just write an equation and have

28
00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.879
the one column

29
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.080
i'm doing this in this example so that i

30
00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.880
can plot

31
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.799
all four of these at one time just show

32
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.240
you a multiply

33
00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:15.439
okay so to get a i've written

34
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.799
uh my a b and c coefficients up here and

35
00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.240
their values

36
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:24.240
so i want to use this

37
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.119
value here at b 1. now when i copy this

38
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.520
value down it's going to want to move

39
00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.920
the

40
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.880
row number so what we need to do is put

41
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.000
in

42
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.400
dollar signs this will fix the column

43
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.520
and fix the row so that matter where i

44
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.280
copy this

45
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:46.079
it will always point here so

46
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.079
so now when i copy down

47
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.880
you'll notice that it doesn't change

48
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.960
update formula it

49
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.719
all stays pointing at b1

50
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.960
so i'll do the same thing here except

51
00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.600
now i'm going to go to

52
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.759
my coefficient b again i'll put the

53
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.680
dollar signs in

54
00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.200
and then i'm going to multiply by x

55
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.599
which is here

56
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.680
okay no dollar signs here because when i

57
00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.680
copy down i want this to change

58
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.959
and then notice there's a little trick

59
00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.200
there all i did was double click

60
00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.920
go ahead and turn that off again so here

61
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.680
i can highlight it i've got my equation

62
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.239
if i double click here in the corner i

63
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.800
could drag down but if i double click

64
00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.360
it'll automatically run down for the

65
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.239
length

66
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.760
of my series so that just makes things

67
00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.160
convenient

68
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.519
again notice it's it's staying here

69
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.080
always looking at b

70
00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.440
even though i'm copying down but it is

71
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.800
updating my row

72
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.720
each time same thing with

73
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.760
cx squared so let's do this value

74
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.640
put the dollar signs in

75
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.879
then we're going to go ahead and

76
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.120
multiply by

77
00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:05.210
my x value squared

78
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.879
again double click down

79
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.879
[Music]

80
00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:16.159
and then we'll go ahead and sum

81
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:18.480
these three and we'll double click down

82
00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:22.159
okay so those are all my values so now

83
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.159
all i need to do is highlight these

84
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.560
if i want to plot all four

85
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.319
i want to plot just some of the columns

86
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.200
and i would highlight the x

87
00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.599
i'd hold the ctrl key and then highlight

88
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.920
any other column that i want to plot

89
00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.080
and here i'm going to plot them all just

90
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.280
go up to insert

91
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.959
go up to charts here for scatter

92
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.840
and stick my scatter plot in

93
00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.920
and that's it if you need to adjust the

94
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.640
y-axis just double-click on it

95
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.319
and you can adjust the bounds and other

96
00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.040
things

97
00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.040
all right
