1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
going to go ahead and take a look at the

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,440
hardness test

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,360
now the hardness test is a relatively

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,719
simple and straightforward instrument

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,440
we basically take a tip of some type a

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,480
hard tip

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,320
this could be a sphere

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,039
it could be a pointed diamond shaped

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,960
there's various kinds of hardness tests

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,800
and the the sphere

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,039
or the tip of this machine could be made

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,519
out of various materials diamond

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,120
being in a lot of the more modern

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,800
instruments

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,399
and the basic idea is you take the

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,480
sample

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,480
and you would load it up to a specified

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,399
load under the machine

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,360
and then after doing so you would go

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,879
back and you would measure

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,120
the diameter of the hole that is left

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,199
behind on the sample

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,239
and so these two samples here if we were

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,440
to just compare

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,120
their images we could say that the

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,159
hardness

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,479
of this is brunel as rock one

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,600
if we compare these two samples we could

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,799
say the hardness

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,760
of this you know sample a here

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,560
is going to be less than the hardness of

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,040
this

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,880
sample b and we can tell that from the

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,400
size of the indent

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,360
so there's a much larger indent here

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,600
in the sample a as compared to b you can

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,360
also start to see in in sample a around

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,360
the edges of this indent that you're

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,119
starting to get a little pile up you can

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,360
see sort of the plastic deformation

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,280
if you were to apply a much smaller load

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,680
and a smaller tip you can get much

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,840
smaller indentations

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,520
but for these two samples they're really

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,360
too small to accurately measure

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,119
so that's the basic idea of the hardness

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,280
test it's relatively straightforward

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,880
it's relatively quick as a test

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,040
so there's a lot of different ones

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,759
there's the brunel hardness

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,280
which uses steel or tungsten carbide

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,399
spheres

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,599
and this is showing you the

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,479
the sphere that's used and then the hole

55
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,000
that's

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,319
left behind the diameter of the hole

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,920
that's left behind

58
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,840
so i guess to be consistent i should

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,920
have used a lowercase d in my

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,200
my last slide but then you go ahead and

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,840
you calculate this

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,959
bernal hardness value by simply taking

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,200
the load

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,480
and plugging in the values of the

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,680
indenter size

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,640
in the hole that was left behind the

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,080
vickers case so similar idea except now

68
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,480
it's got a diamond

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,879
uh pure middle tip you can see it's a

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,959
four-sided diamond

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,280
again you're going to go ahead and take

72
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,160
a look at the hole that's left behind

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,440
and you're looking at the diameter of

74
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,400
this hole

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,959
the new hardness this one is designed

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,319
for samples that sometimes are too

77
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,560
brittle for the vickers and where the

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,959
vickers might crack the sample

79
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,040
the nuke is a similar type but now it's

80
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,239
got this long axis

81
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,200
and so this allows you to measure

82
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,080
at least this long axis as a hole on the

83
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,000
surface

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,519
and you don't need to go as deep in

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,239
order to be able to

86
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,319
just accurately see what you might with

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,040
the vickers

88
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,319
and so it's got also its own hardness

89
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,120
equation here

90
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,360
and then rockwell can use diamond cones

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,640
or steel spheres

92
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,959
and it has various standard loads that

93
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,760
is

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,920
that are used and in the rockwell case

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,519
you're looking at the depth

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,000
of the indenter and i believe if you go

97
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,840
ahead and take a look at the

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
video that's posted in canvas on

99
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,440
hardness it'll walk you through

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,440
this rockwell case

101
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,879
so there is a the scale for these

102
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,680
different hardness values you can

103
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,480
convert from one scale to another and

104
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,360
some of these tests um

105
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,239
cover a much greater range of hardness

106
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,280
values

107
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,120
than other tests

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,560
so here's some new partners values just

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,640
for comparison

110
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,000
diamond of course is our hardest

111
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,479
material that we have

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
that's why it's used as the indenter tip

113
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,120
in many cases

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,199
7000 on the new partner scale

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,000
and to go on down to something we're

116
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,800
familiar with like a window type glass

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,800
we're looking at a hardness of about

118
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,800
550.

119
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,680
and then you're in the 2000 ranges for

120
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,639
the carbides tungsten carbide silicon

121
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,680
carbide

122
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,520
boron carbide aluminum oxide

123
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,440
and these are usually materials used in

124
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,160
a lot of cases for for grinding

125
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,160
applications

126
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,520
so the value of the hardness test is

127
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,800
that it's quick

128
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,040
and it's easy most of these instruments

129
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,360
are

130
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,800
portable so this means that you could

131
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,560
put one of these instruments on a

132
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,400
production line

133
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,840
and then as a sheet or some other

134
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,720
material that you're

135
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,199
producing comes through you could just

136
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,120
place a small indent in the corner

137
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,400
in that sense it's non-destructive and

138
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,720
you can get a quick measurement for

139
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,880
hardness

140
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,320
and that's a quality check if the

141
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,639
hardness changes then you know you've

142
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,240
got a quality control problem

143
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:27,440
the other advantage of this is also that

144
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,440
the hardness can be

145
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,120
correlated with the tensile strength and

146
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,440
the yield strength but here we've got

147
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,720
the case for the tensile strength

148
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,639
showing that if you were to do a

149
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,240
grinnell hardness test

150
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,080
and these are the units that the bernal

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,000
hardness test comes out

152
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,919
as kilograms per millimeter squared

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,840
and you multiply that by 3.45 you get

154
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,600
tensile strength a pretty good measure

155
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,919
of the tensile strength

156
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,520
of that material now this holds very

157
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,960
well for the steels that's where it's

158
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,280
originally developed

159
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,639
although a lot of people use that number

160
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,120
kind of blindly across

161
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,840
different materials you really shouldn't

162
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,600
and

163
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,039
you can see here that depending upon

164
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,360
whether you're looking at a brass

165
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,280
or a cast iron there are different

166
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,639
slopes different relationships here

167
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,560
so but once that relationship's known

168
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,240
then you have a nice way of doing a

169
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,919
quick test that you can correlate to

170
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,280
tensile strength

171
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,039
because otherwise you've got to take

172
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,400
your material that you're producing

173
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,960
you've got to cut out a

174
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,639
sample maybe a dog bone specimen you've

175
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,280
got to take it to get the instron

176
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,680
machine

177
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,720
and you know mount it in the grips and

178
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,880
run the test

179
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,360
it's a very you know it takes a more

180
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,680
time it's very time consuming

181
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,880
where this hardness test is quick may

182
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,880
take just a few seconds

183
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,759
all right
