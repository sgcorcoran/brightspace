00:00:01.673 --> 00:00:04.500
The two types that we're going to look at

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.698
is what's called face centered cubic and

00:00:06.698 --> 00:00:08.583
body centered cubic. That's where we're

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:11.096
going to focus this class. And you can

00:00:11.096 --> 00:00:13.923
see many of the common metals have one of

00:00:13.923 --> 00:00:16.121
these two types of structures. We're also

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:18.634
going to talk just very briefly about the

00:00:18.634 --> 00:00:20.519
hexagonal close pack system, but we're

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.195
going to focus all of our. Calculations

00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:25.603
on the face centered.

00:00:25.603 --> 00:00:28.011
FCC or BCC body

00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:30.676
centered. So let's

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:33.414
first take a look at the face

00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:36.152
centered cubic. As you can see, the

00:00:36.152 --> 00:00:38.499
face centered cubic structure, the 1st,

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:41.237
it's a cube cubic. So we've got

00:00:41.237 --> 00:00:43.975
atoms forming the cube here if I

00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:46.713
look at the positions of the atom

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.452
centers and then at the face of

00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:52.164
each cube. You have an atom,

00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:53.454
so face centered cubic.

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:57.547
There's another view of that, and this is

00:00:57.547 --> 00:01:00.261
showing you what the true unit cell is.

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:02.974
That is the repeat unit, and it's showing

00:01:02.974 --> 00:01:05.688
you here now that we are going indeed

00:01:05.688 --> 00:01:07.044
from the atom centers.

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:10.931
And so that's what's actually repeated.

00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:13.926
So if we continue to add in more and

00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:16.921
more pieces, we can see that we build up

00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:18.585
this face centered cubic structure.

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:24.412
All right, So a couple of things we want

00:01:24.412 --> 00:01:27.058
to know about when we're looking at the

00:01:27.058 --> 00:01:29.373
structures. We want to know about how

00:01:29.373 --> 00:01:31.688
efficient the atoms are packed into the

00:01:31.688 --> 00:01:34.334
structure and how much of that is, how

00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:37.311
much of this unit cell is space and how

00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:40.262
much of it is atom. And we want

00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:43.189
to do something about. How to

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.013
find?The length of

00:01:46.013 --> 00:01:48.968
the cube edge A in terms

00:01:48.968 --> 00:01:50.445
of the radius.

00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:54.506
R of our atoms. OK, so first thing, let's

00:01:54.506 --> 00:01:57.306
go ahead and take a look at the number

00:01:57.306 --> 00:01:59.795
of atoms per unit cell. Can we have

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:02.596
listed here 4 and how do we get that?

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:06.425
So we've got, if we take a look

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:09.095
at our cell up here, you can see

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:11.765
that we've got 1/2 of an atom here

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:12.766
at the face.

00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:17.606
OK. And there are six

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:20.399
faces. Times 1/2

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.176
of an atom for each face center.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.953
So that's three atoms. And then notice

00:02:25.953 --> 00:02:28.730
that the atoms on the corners are

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.506
actually an eighth of an atom, and

00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:32.696
there's eight corners.

00:02:34.536 --> 00:02:37.333
So that's one atom and so

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:40.130
we have 4 complete atom volumes

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.927
in one of our unit cells.

00:02:44.937 --> 00:02:46.457
So we've got 4 atoms.

00:02:48.157 --> 00:02:48.987
Per.

00:02:50.307 --> 00:02:52.057
Area cubed.

00:02:53.177 --> 00:02:56.041
Of our unit cell, right? Our volume of

00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:58.547
our unit cell is just a ^3.

00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:03.332
So let's find a the edge length here.

00:03:03.332 --> 00:03:06.248
So what we're going to do to find

00:03:06.248 --> 00:03:09.163
a is we want to take a look

00:03:09.163 --> 00:03:11.714
at our space filling model again and

00:03:11.714 --> 00:03:14.265
locate where the atoms are touching. So

00:03:14.265 --> 00:03:16.816
notice in the face centered system, the

00:03:16.816 --> 00:03:19.003
atoms are touching along the face

00:03:19.003 --> 00:03:21.596
diagonals. So what

00:03:21.596 --> 00:03:23.873
that tells me

00:03:23.873 --> 00:03:26.150
is that I've

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.668
got 1234R.

00:03:29.278 --> 00:03:31.972
4 radii and relative to a.

00:03:31.972 --> 00:03:34.666
If I draw my right triangle

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:37.360
here, I got A and so

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.054
that 4R there. The hypotenuse is

00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:42.748
then just a square root 2.

00:03:43.838 --> 00:03:46.748
OK, so that gives me that a is

00:03:46.748 --> 00:03:49.658
equal to 4R over the square root 2.

00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:53.211
Just just another way of writing 2R

00:03:53.211 --> 00:03:55.911
square root 2. I'm going to leave it

00:03:55.911 --> 00:03:58.611
in this 4R square root 2 format because

00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:01.311
you see this will be similar to what

00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:03.674
we see for the body centered cubic

00:04:03.674 --> 00:04:06.374
structure. So I like this format a little

00:04:06.374 --> 00:04:08.736
better. All right, so the atomic packing

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:11.099
factor here, how well to be pack.

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.349
It's just simply the volume of atoms.

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.380
Over the volume of the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.123
unit cell. OK,

00:04:22.123 --> 00:04:24.846
so it's the fractional amount

00:04:24.846 --> 00:04:27.568
of atom per total volume.

00:04:27.568 --> 00:04:30.290
We said the volume of

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.013
atoms. Well, one atom is

00:04:33.013 --> 00:04:35.735
4 thirds Ï€ R cubed

00:04:35.735 --> 00:04:38.457
and we've got 4 atoms

00:04:38.457 --> 00:04:41.179
total in the unit cell.

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.815
The volume of our unit cell is

00:04:44.815 --> 00:04:45.580
a ^3.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.731
And a member. We already have it

00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:53.492
written up here. A is equal to

00:04:53.492 --> 00:04:55.070
4 R sqrt 2.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.865
I think so. I'm going to put

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:01.529
that in for R square root 2

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.461
^3. All right,

00:05:04.461 --> 00:05:07.265
so you just go ahead and simplify

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:10.070
these numbers. The R's cancel out, Plug

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.874
the rest of this in your calculator

00:05:12.874 --> 00:05:15.678
and you're going to get .74 O.

00:05:15.678 --> 00:05:18.483
In other words, this is 74% atom,

00:05:18.483 --> 00:05:21.287
26% then is space in this unit

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:24.035
cell. This is actually the best. We

00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:26.778
can do and so this is referred to as a

00:05:26.778 --> 00:05:27.601
close packed structure.

00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:33.261
The body centered cubic structure, again,

00:05:33.261 --> 00:05:36.072
we've got a cube. OK, we always

00:05:36.072 --> 00:05:38.081
call the edge length a.

00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:42.449
But now we don't have atoms in the face,

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.197
but we have an atom sitting here in the

00:05:45.197 --> 00:05:47.335
body center. So body centered cubic, it's

00:05:47.335 --> 00:05:48.251
non close packed.

00:05:50.721 --> 00:05:53.221
Let's build that by structure atomic

00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:55.721
packing factor now or the packing

00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:58.706
efficiency is 68%. There's

00:05:58.706 --> 00:06:00.981
now 2 atoms in this unit cell.

00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.189
And the edge length now is 4R over

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:08.167
sqrt 3 and I'm going to leave these

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:10.789
for you. To

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:13.536
drive yourself and then this is

00:06:13.536 --> 00:06:16.282
the right triangle that's going to

00:06:16.282 --> 00:06:19.029
help you with this. OK, so

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:20.402
edge length a.

00:06:22.442 --> 00:06:24.922
This is across the face, so that's a

00:06:24.922 --> 00:06:27.826
square root 2. And

00:06:27.826 --> 00:06:29.892
then this is our body diagonal.

00:06:31.782 --> 00:06:34.676
Yeah, I guess I'll go ahead and give that

00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:37.569
to you a sqrt 3 right body diagonal of

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:38.212
the cube.
