1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,199
let's take a look at how to figure out

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,960
the

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,639
atom placement um on a specific plane

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,519
so we're going to go ahead in this case

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,080
and look at the atom placement

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,880
for the face center cubic structure on

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,320
the one

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,000
zero zero plane that's a face plane

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,080
it's the first thing to do is to figure

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,439
out where the plane is so

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,199
a one zero zero plane we kind of work in

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,400
reverse

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,960
and take the reciprocals

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,880
this will tell us the intercepts right

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,440
so if i take the reciprocal of one it's

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,120
one

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,800
and then remember these zeros then

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,640
correspond to

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,920
infinity so this means that it's

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,879
parallel

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,559
to the y direction parallel to the

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,920
z-direction

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,920
and it intersects the x-axis

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,960
at one right so that's this plane here

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,320
across the face

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,160
okay so that's the yz plane

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,680
all right so that's our our one zero

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,240
zero plane

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,799
and we like to use this sort of exploded

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,760
view

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,560
model because it's easier to see the

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,720
structure

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,400
where the planes are but we have to keep

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,600
in mind when we go ahead and

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,680
draw the atom placement

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,439
that we need to be looking at the actual

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,439
space filling model

38
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,200
right where the atoms are enlarged and

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,680
we see the atoms for example

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,840
are touching along the face diagonals

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,320
and that's very important

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,640
so i want to sketch that sort of view

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,920
okay so again if i go ahead and look at

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,040
the

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,439
1 0 0 plane or this particular case let

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,600
me go ahead and keep the

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,240
labeling that they've actually done here

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,479
this would be

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,479
a zero zero one plane

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,399
so let's talk about that a little bit

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,000
because that looks

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,079
a little confusing too because it looks

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,119
like this plane is

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,719
intercepting here at the origin

55
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,640
so whenever we do have a plane it goes

56
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,319
through the origin we always have to

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,360
shift it by one

58
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,200
unit cell direction we can shift it in

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,840
any direction that we want as long as

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,120
it's

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,599
by a unit cell vector so in this

62
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,680
particular case what i will do is we'll

63
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,440
take this plane and we'll go ahead and

64
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,440
shift it up

65
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,640
so that it's now located up here at the

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,120
top

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,160
okay now located up there at the top you

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,760
can see that the

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,160
intercept along the z-axis is one

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,680
and you can see that it's parallel now

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,640
to the x and y

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,440
axes and that's exactly what we have

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,640
here

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,879
as to 0 0 1 plane

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,000
so this applies any time it goes through

76
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,040
the origin

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,560
we're just going to need to shift shift

78
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,319
our plane

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,160
okay so we're taking a look though at

80
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,519
this bottom plane in terms of the

81
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,760
labeling and you can see now again

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,680
since we know they're touching along the

83
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,239
face diagonals

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,280
that when we sketch that we're going to

85
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,280
get this sketch here

86
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,480
and many times if you're if you if

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,120
you're sketching it yourselves

88
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,720
you know you can't draw a perfect square

89
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,680
that's certainly understandable what you

90
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,720
want to do is just go ahead and mark up

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,760
your sketch to let me know

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,680
for example that you drew a square so if

93
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,799
i go ahead and label

94
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,640
these two edges as a and i know that the

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,319
intent there is to make a square not a

96
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,680
rectangle

97
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,280
i also could draw in the directions that

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,519
the atoms are touching and you know

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,720
maybe just label

100
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:51,680
touching say along

101
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,680
face diagonals

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,760
now everything's clear and i know that

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,400
that was that was your intent

104
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,360
okay so that would be our zero zero one

105
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,640
plane

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,640
for the face-centered cubic

107
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,159
one other point you know we started this

108
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,879
off by saying we were going to sketch

109
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,200
the one zero

110
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,519
zero all of the phase planes in the

111
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,040
cubic system are identical

112
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,560
so it actually doesn't matter whether

113
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,840
we're sketching the 1

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,040
0 0 which is here the 0

115
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,880
0 1 which is the top

116
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,000
or the 0 1 0 which would be

117
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,280
this face out here those

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,360
all have the same geometry the same atom

119
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,600
placements in packing

120
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,919
and so we will sometimes refer to these

121
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,199
as a family of planes

122
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,680
since they're all identical and the

123
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,080
family of planes if you see it written

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,120
will look something like this with curly

125
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,919
braces but

126
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,639
i'm going to generally avoid that for

127
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,639
this class

128
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,479
all right what about the body centered

129
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,440
cubic let's go ahead and take a look at

130
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,880
the one

131
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,600
one zero plane for the body center cubic

132
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,360
so again this means that intercepts is

133
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,919
going to be one on the x

134
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:15,039
one on the y and then parallel

135
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,759
to the z so we'll go ahead and draw that

136
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,680
we've got an intercept of one

137
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:25,199
one right we call this our a

138
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,919
our b in our c

139
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,919
directions

140
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,039
and so i've got those two intercepts and

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,840
then since it's parallel to the z

142
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,880
then i know that my plane then looks

143
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,560
like this so that's the plane we're

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,039
going to sketch

145
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,720
um what do i see i've got atoms at the

146
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,720
corners

147
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,840
and i've got an atom right here in the

148
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,160
middle

149
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:55,600
right located at the one one-half

150
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,600
one-half one-half coordinate

151
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,000
and that one's also on this plane

152
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,880
so now to sketch this i'm going to have

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,720
to think again

154
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:11,120
about my space filling model

155
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:14,560
and realize that my atoms touch

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,600
along the body diagonal

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,000
okay and so in terms of this plane let

158
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,840
me

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,840
change my color for a second here

160
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,039
this means the atoms are touching right

161
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,160
along these body

162
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,160
a terrible line

163
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,000
along these body diagonals

164
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,720
and then from this one to this one

165
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:49,520
that's the plane that i want

166
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:52,000
to sketch

167
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,919
all right i know that's a bit of a mess

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,039
so here it is

169
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,880
with atoms labeled and now when you're

170
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,199
sketching a plane like this one notice

171
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,880
this is not the same as the one zero

172
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,199
zero that we sketch for the face

173
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,960
centered although it looks similar

174
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,759
but it's not square any long but a

175
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,759
rectangular

176
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,319
plane orientation so this is

177
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,360
a and our lattice parameter which would

178
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,199
be this

179
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,120
dimension here and then we've got

180
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,319
cutting across the face so this is

181
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:30,240
a square root 2. right so that's

182
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:33,120
this distance here is a square root 2.

183
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,360
so that would be my rectangular

184
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,440
placement of the atoms and so i do want

185
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,440
to label that

186
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,160
or if i'm on a test where it's multiple

187
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,400
choice and you see these sorts of labels

188
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,240
it's trying to tell you that this indeed

189
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,599
is supposed to be rectangular and it's

190
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,599
not square

191
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,120
so it's very important and then again

192
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,479
they're touching you can see here now

193
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,520
along these

194
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,560
body diagonals

195
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,080
okay so that's it good luck

196
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,080
see you next time
