00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.282
All right, for homework you will

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:06.853
be looking at the attractive and

00:00:06.853 --> 00:00:09.425
repulsive energies between two ions. This

00:00:09.425 --> 00:00:11.997
is this example we have potassium

00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:14.568
and chloride. I don't remember I

00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:17.140
thought my head with your homework

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.712
was but they will give you

00:00:19.712 --> 00:00:21.689
the. Attractive equation, the repulsive

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.816
equation. And remember, again, what we

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:26.653
need is just the net. So we're just

00:00:26.653 --> 00:00:29.489
simply going to plot, simply going to add

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.326
these two. We're going to do this in

00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:35.162
a plot, so I'll show you what it

00:00:35.162 --> 00:00:38.113
looks like in Excel. Um,

00:00:38.113 --> 00:00:40.937
and then I'll post maybe a video helping

00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:43.408
you actually work through Excel if you're

00:00:43.408 --> 00:00:46.232
having trouble. But in Excel, we can go

00:00:46.232 --> 00:00:48.703
ahead and make a column for the

00:00:48.703 --> 00:00:51.174
attractive for repulsive and then add the

00:00:51.174 --> 00:00:53.998
two and then plot all of those versus

00:00:53.998 --> 00:00:56.469
the radius R and we'll generate this

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.294
curve that we just. Call and then from

00:00:59.294 --> 00:01:01.981
there we can read off the bond energy

00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:03.661
and the equilibriums atom spacing.

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.504
OK, so again, this is going to remind you

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:12.085
of the equation. This is the data that

00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:14.988
was given and I have all of that written

00:01:14.988 --> 00:01:16.601
over here from my constants.

00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:21.622
In this case, I actually went through and

00:01:21.622 --> 00:01:23.828
did the derivative of the equation and

00:01:23.828 --> 00:01:26.349
found the equations for E0 and R0. So

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:28.555
that's what these were for. You don't

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.761
have to do that, these are calculated.

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:35.252
And So what I need to do is

00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:37.650
just simply plot this equation. So what

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.391
I'm going to do is make a column

00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:43.131
of R values and the units are in

00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:45.530
nanometers. So I'll go ahead and redo

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.270
that. And then I'll make a column for

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.668
the attractive energy piece and a column

00:01:50.668 --> 00:01:52.381
for the repulsive energy piece.

00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:56.136
And then I'll go ahead and add those two

00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:58.860
for the net energy. And then all I need

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.281
to do is select these columns and tell

00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:03.703
Excel to go ahead and scatter plot it.

00:02:03.703 --> 00:02:06.124
And I'll get something like this here on

00:02:06.124 --> 00:02:08.849
the right. I know when you first go ahead

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.967
and do this in Excel, which you'll

00:02:10.967 --> 00:02:13.086
probably find is that you don't see

00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:15.119
actually anything. Except for maybe a

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:17.834
flat line, and then it looks like your

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:20.548
curve kind of does that. So if you

00:02:20.548 --> 00:02:23.263
double check on the limits of the axis

00:02:23.263 --> 00:02:25.299
here, you'll probably find that they're

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.013
very, very high so that you can't see

00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:30.728
as well, which is only on the order

00:02:30.728 --> 00:02:33.443
of in this case, say almost .5 I

00:02:33.443 --> 00:02:36.182
mean. Almost -5 EV's and that's because

00:02:36.182 --> 00:02:38.172
it very close spacings. The repulsive

00:02:38.172 --> 00:02:41.157
part is very very large so you notice the

00:02:41.157 --> 00:02:44.142
size of these numbers. So what you can do

00:02:44.142 --> 00:02:47.127
is either skip some of those when you go

00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:49.780
ahead and do your plotting or easier just

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.765
go ahead and double click on your Y axis

00:02:52.765 --> 00:02:55.389
and change the scale. Is something much

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.412
more reasonable and you'll get yourcurve.
