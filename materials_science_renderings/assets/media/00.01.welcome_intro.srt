1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,440
all right welcome to uh

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,599
mse 2044 fundamentals of materials

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,759
engineering i'm going to try and uh

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,080
answer a bunch of your questions about

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,880
how

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,960
class is going to work in this

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,480
asynchronous and synchronous online

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,920
environment

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,680
so our class has both the uh

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,720
synchronous um and asynchronous

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,239
components so the main part of the class

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,520
on tuesdays and thursdays

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,920
meaning that's what i'm going to try and

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,399
make sure i post your lectures

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,040
that part of the class is asynchronous

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,760
and

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:47,039
the friday lecture from 125 to 215

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,920
is actually a synchronous so make sure

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,480
you get that on your

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,640
on your schedules that's going to be the

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,480
communications program

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,960
which is integrated throughout this

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,520
entire course

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,120
so we'll have a workshop on friday and

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,920
we'll talk more about the

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,879
communications program and the research

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,840
paper that

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,320
you all are going to write so let's

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,640
first

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,520
take a look at the canvas site so we can

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,920
kind of see what's

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,600
going on there because we do have

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,920
several different

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,680
i guess sites and software that that you

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,720
all be interacting with

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,520
through this course so the main part of

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,880
the site

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,680
you can see here in canvas we'll have

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,280
the

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,040
policy guide just make sure you look

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,240
through that the

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,360
homework submission guide and also this

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,920
video lectures this is a new link so if

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,520
you

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,560
have already looked at the canvas site

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,880
you may not have noticed this one

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,600
but what i'm going to be doing is

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,000
placing

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,840
this is a this is one of your pages in

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,520
your page view

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,720
i'm going to continue to update

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,720
see if this opens for us

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,159
all right well why that's working what

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,520
i'm going to do is i'm going to

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,640
upload the video lectures and i'm going

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,800
to keep

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,399
on this page a kind of running table of

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,000
contents for you

59
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,080
so your video lectures will just get

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,959
embedded directly into

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
the page views in canvas so you can see

62
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,280
them

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,040
relatively easily i'm not sure what it's

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,560
doing right now

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,440
um there is a

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,040
media tool in canvas and if you were to

67
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,920
look there you'd see there's

68
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,239
a bunch of video files unfortunately

69
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,959
that tool is not very good

70
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,319
at organizing things so when i tried to

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,640
pull a lot of that over it got

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,879
completely disorganized so

73
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,000
just ignore that i mean i'm going to try

74
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,800
and just keep

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,840
up to date this particular pages table

76
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,840
of contents

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,440
okay so here it is finally it's come up

78
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,720
for me

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,400
you can see there's not a lot there

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,840
right now there's just this chapter one

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,599
and two playlist

82
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,879
and then after i finish this video i'm

83
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,640
going to put that on here as an

84
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,760
introduction to the class you'll see

85
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,680
that

86
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,000
but if we were to go to this chapter one

87
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:17,280
and two playlists this will just pull up

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,760
another page file that's in your system

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,120
and then on here what we're going to see

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,560
is the

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,159
chapter 1 lecture and the chapter 2

92
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,040
lecture

93
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,640
here they come so there's our chapter 2

94
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,760
and you can always make this full screen

95
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,799
if you like

96
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,519
and then the chapter one hopefully

97
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,319
eventually come up here

98
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,080
okay so there it is there's chapter one

99
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,200
so you've got these two

100
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,040
that'll get you started uh for this week

101
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,720
and then i'll continue to add these as

102
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,840
we as we move on i think this will be a

103
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,120
better way to organize

104
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,000
things you can always go to the

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,720
view all pages if you want to see what's

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,799
kind of going on behind the scenes

107
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,080
and i know canvas has been been behaving

108
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,239
really slow today

109
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,879
i think that's part of the problem here

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,799
uh hopefully that'll get better

111
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,040
as the semester gets gets going

112
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,639
okay so this brings up all of the pages

113
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,519
that we've got going on you can see here

114
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,359
this is the

115
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,959
chapter one and two playlists then i'll

116
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,479
continue to add those

117
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,400
um but you don't have to worry about it

118
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,639
it's all here in the

119
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,080
video lectures file folder that's

120
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,960
basically the big

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,000
table of contents that i was just

122
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,800
showing you

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,800
previously

124
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,400
so there it is okay so that's where the

125
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,120
video lectures will show up um let's see

126
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,120
let's take a look

127
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,400
at the um at some of the announcements

128
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,240
because i'm getting a lot of different

129
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,759
kinds of questions

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,320
that um lead me to believe that

131
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,759
you all aren't quite reading all of the

132
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,880
announcements and i know that they're

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,240
long and

134
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,240
you're probably skimming through them

135
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,560
but a lot of your questions are actually

136
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,840
answered in there

137
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,600
although maybe i've written in a

138
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,919
confusing way so let's let's go ahead

139
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,560
and

140
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,720
take a look at those announcements for

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,720
you

142
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,479
okay so we've got three announcements so

143
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,400
far in the class

144
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,440
let's go ahead and we'll take a look

145
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,039
quickly well i'll say the first one

146
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,960
i sent pretty early on before the

147
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,240
semester actually started

148
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,479
this one's just giving you some

149
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,320
information on the textbook and

150
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,560
the requirement for using the

151
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,440
perusal.com site so hopefully

152
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
many of you i know at least well half so

153
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,000
actually not

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,600
too many of you i've already signed up

155
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,120
for the perusal you do need to get the

156
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,199
e-text

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,400
um that's in perusal that's where you're

158
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,720
going to be

159
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,400
annotating and commenting and

160
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,240
interacting with me and with the

161
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,840
other fellow students through the

162
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,759
perusal site i'll talk about that a

163
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,560
little bit more in a second

164
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,680
um and that is graded so i know that's

165
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,600
always the uh

166
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,120
motivation that gets you working on some

167
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,000
of these things

168
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,919
so over the grade breakdown in just a

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,960
second

170
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:15,360
all right so let's take a look at the

171
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,360
assignments uh clarification here

172
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,639
okay so here it is looking at the

173
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,440
assignments so

174
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,600
again all of your assignment due dates

175
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,759
will be in one place

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,800
in canvas so even though you have

177
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,560
assignments in different places

178
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,000
the canvas will actually show you the

179
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,560
due dates for all of them

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
and which assignments are due and so

181
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,800
i'll take a look at that

182
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,800
also with you in just a second but for

183
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,520
this chapter one and two for example

184
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,600
there are several components to your

185
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,360
your homework that you can all find

186
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,919
under assignments

187
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,840
you can also find it under syllabus so

188
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,160
i'll show you that as well

189
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:01,680
and you can find it under calendar

190
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,039
okay so right now there's

191
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,880
for your first assignment you're going

192
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,039
to have

193
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:12,240
a canvas discussion and a canvas poll

194
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,960
these are very quick and this should not

195
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,560
take you

196
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,720
a lot of time at all it's just kind of

197
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,919
for fun and

198
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,880
talking about whether you prefer glass

199
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,560
cans

200
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,479
or plastic bottles for drinking soda so

201
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,400
this is technically done through a quiz

202
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,919
don't worry this is not again not a big

203
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,599
deal just asking for your preference you

204
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,440
can't get it wrong

205
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,199
all right the canvas discussion is where

206
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,560
you can talk about why you made your

207
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,479
preference and this will link you

208
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,919
automatically to the poll

209
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:45,520
okay so that's here under discussions

210
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,160
the um they're also callister your

211
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,680
textbook

212
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,199
there are problems that will be doing

213
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,039
there each

214
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,960
week so maybe sometimes more than one

215
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,199
homework each week depending on how many

216
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,960
chapters we go through

217
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:02,160
and in the perusal software

218
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,759
i mark all of your homework at the end

219
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,840
of those chapters

220
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,599
actually i guess in the e-text it's at

221
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,599
the beginning of the chapters

222
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,639
but i will mark highlight all of the

223
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,599
ones you need to do

224
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,280
and i will hashtag them with homework so

225
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,120
that in perusal

226
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,280
you can easily see where they are okay

227
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,639
now those homework problems are workout

228
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,960
problems

229
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,599
and once you work those problems out you

230
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,720
can turn those into a pdf file

231
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,320
and you will upload them in canvas okay

232
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,080
so canvas is actually where

233
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,719
where that goes the everything goes into

234
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,880
canvas

235
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,800
except for your reading assignment so

236
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,159
the reading assignments

237
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,160
are listed in perusal i'll have a spot

238
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,800
here in canvas that just lists them so

239
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,279
that

240
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,200
you have a due date and a reminder that

241
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,080
that you have reading

242
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,360
but you don't need to turn anything in

243
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,640
in canvas

244
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,320
okay so perusal will grade your reading

245
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,600
assignments

246
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,000
and your reading assignments consist

247
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,040
of reading through the text and

248
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,760
highlighting

249
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,360
annotating answering interacting with

250
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,120
other students and i'm going to go

251
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,560
through a little bit of that

252
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,880
and perusal is going to grade you

253
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,160
automatically so it's got a little bit

254
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,000
of

255
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,519
some artificial intelligence going on a

256
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,360
little bit there

257
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,560
and i'll talk again about that in just a

258
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,360
second

259
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,240
the other place problems that we may

260
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,800
have

261
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,720
and we do in this first set is you're

262
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,640
going to have what's called ces

263
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:40,720
edupack problems so ces edupac is

264
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,240
a software for material selection that

265
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,839
you'll use in other courses throughout

266
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,760
our curricula

267
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,640
it allows you to look up all sorts of

268
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,440
material properties

269
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,000
so i will have supplemental problems

270
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,080
that will

271
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,279
allow you to use that software so make

272
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,240
sure you go to the

273
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,279
student software i believe that's online

274
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,279
now

275
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,399
and you can just download the ces

276
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,399
edupack

277
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,880
so there is a cost for that i believe

278
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:11,120
it's about 25 bucks

279
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,360
okay all right so i know that's a lot of

280
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,640
different places and that's why

281
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,279
if you go to the assignments link let me

282
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,360
just

283
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,360
click over there right now

284
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,000
okay so here we are in the assignments

285
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,920
link

286
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,160
you're seeing my view so there's a lot

287
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,320
more on here than what you'll see

288
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,519
don't worry about all the gray stuff

289
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,959
none of that will show up

290
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,600
it's only the green here that's going to

291
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,720
show up in

292
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,279
in your view and that's all you have to

293
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,839
worry about so perusal

294
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,760
okay there'll always be a reminder here

295
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,480
your chapter one and two reading that's

296
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,160
due

297
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,959
it's due august 28th that's friday

298
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,240
okay perusal this reading assignments

299
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,120
are going to count as ten percent of

300
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,519
your grade

301
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,360
okay and it's listed here for you and

302
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,200
as periodically as we move through the

303
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,519
course and certainly by the end

304
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,320
i will take the grades from perusal and

305
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,640
then i will

306
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,600
substitute them directly in here so they

307
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,959
end up showing

308
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,320
up in your gradebook all right but

309
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,440
you'll be able to see your perusal

310
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,279
grades

311
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,079
after the assignments are done and you

312
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,440
get graded for that

313
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,440
all right the homework

314
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,480
so this could be a variety of things

315
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,880
this is the

316
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,320
in this first part this is the beverage

317
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,240
container

318
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,680
uh and the poll you know these aren't

319
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,640
going to count

320
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,279
for much it's just participation it's

321
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,440
your

322
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:46,800
callister workout problems and your ces

323
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,120
edupack software problems so that's all

324
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,160
that's going on right now

325
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,440
and you can see again the due dates um

326
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,120
august 25th that's today

327
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,240
by midnight so do those and then august

328
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,480
31st which is monday for your

329
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,760
other two sets of problems uh but

330
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,839
they're all listed here

331
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,000
so even if your homework is up in

332
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,519
perusal it's going to show up here

333
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,800
as a due date all right

334
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,279
so for your callister problems

335
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,200
and your ces edupack problems you would

336
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,639
just click on these links here

337
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,440
and it'll give you the ability to upload

338
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,680
your pdf file once you've got that that

339
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,920
finished

340
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,360
the cs edupack problems a lot of times

341
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,720
it's just going to ask you to look up a

342
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,839
record

343
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,880
right now anyway and find out a certain

344
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,800
property

345
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,639
so all you have to do is is do that in

346
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,720
the software then just take a small

347
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:51,600
screen clip of the spot in your

348
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,120
software that shows the value that we

349
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,399
were looking for and just paste that

350
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,200
into

351
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,880
maybe pdf annotator or word and then

352
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,639
save that as a pdf file

353
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,079
but you just want to take a screenshot

354
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,720
of the results you don't have to

355
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,600
document every step you went through

356
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,800
for the edupack problems here okay but

357
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,920
both of these will get turned in

358
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,519
all right so don't worry about all the

359
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,279
rest of the stuff we've got a lot to

360
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,480
look forward to here

361
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,800
um so this you know this may get a

362
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,560
little bit confusing you know perhaps to

363
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,120
sort through so if you do go to the

364
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,120
syllabus

365
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,320
and you scroll down

366
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,680
apparently it gets messed up there if

367
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,440
you scroll down to

368
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:39,279
the bottom then this is just going to be

369
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,519
a summary list of everything that's due

370
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,839
okay so everything that right now is is

371
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,839
there

372
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,959
all right so some of these actually

373
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,160
won't show up in your view because

374
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,600
these are not actually i should go into

375
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,360
the

376
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,199
student view let me show you from the

377
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,480
student view because this is

378
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,480
a bit confusing

379
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,240

there we go much better so right now

382
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,839
when you go to your student view you're

383
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,279
going to see the

384
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,240
the discussion and the poll

385
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,839
your reading assignment and your calstr

386
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,120
and ces problems

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,920
okay so they're just listed here in date

388
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,720
order so

389
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,440
you can't go wrong taking a look at the

390
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,880
summary

391
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,800
of what's coming up okay if you take a

let's see the ces edupack problems

394
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,560
if we were to take a look at that you'll

395
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,160
see it'll walk you through exactly what

396
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,320
you need to do with that software and

397
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,360
i'm going to put up a short video

398
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,120
um for thursday

399
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,040
that'll walk you through ces we'll take

400
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,480
a look at that program so

401
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,079
you can just wait don't worry about this

402
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,079
homework until after we do that

403
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,560
all right let's see what else do we got

404
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,560
um

405
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,199
all right that so let's go um let's see

406
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,560
look calendars

407
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,560
so that's the additional place

408
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,240
so your courses this should be for all

409
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,480
of your canvas courses

410
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
um should be here and you can color code

411
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,480
them as you like

412
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,839
but again you'll see now on a calendar

413
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,680
the due dates of your different

414
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,519
assignments and you can

415
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,440
click on these directly if you want so

416
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,560
that's another place to look to help

417
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,560
organize you a little bit

418
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:38,079
all right so i think that is all of the

419
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:42,079
canvas stuff so let us jump

420
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,079
over to perusal

421
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,880
all right so in perusal

422
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,000
come over here to the course home

423
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,000
assignments link up here this is where

424
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
your assignments are going to be

425
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,279
these are your reading assignments so

426
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,160
right now we just have this

427
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,440
chapter one and two reading assignment

428
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,000
okay

429
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,480
and what you're going to do if you open

430
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,240
that assignment and you'll see i've

431
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,240
already commented some things in here

432
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:22,000
i'll wait for that to load just a second

433
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:26,240
all right so here's the textbook

434
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,759
and you're reading and

435
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,279
i'll usually go through a lot of these

436
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,079
chapters beforehand

437
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,880
and as you're reading them and i will

438
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,360
comment

439
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,120
on your comments this is a great place

440
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,399
to put questions

441
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,959
as you're reading through if you're

442
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,399
having trouble with anything

443
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,000
this is the great place to put your

444
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,079
questions

445
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,680
if you start your homeworks this is a

446
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,360
good reason not to start them at the

447
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,480
last minute

448
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,160
but if you start your homeworks actually

449
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,519
you don't have any in chapter one let me

450
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,639
go to

451
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,639
chapter two here

452
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:08,000
all right here's chapter two and if you

453
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,039
start looking through these

454
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,280
you will find

455
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,799
here we go that your homeworks are

456
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,600
highlighted

457
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,559
okay so i highlight these and this is

458
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,000
just a

459
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,959
comment um many times it'll just be the

460
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,799
problem number

461
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,079
and i'll hashtag it homework so you

462
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,160
don't miss it

463
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,520
um this one has a comment you know make

464
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,840
sure you show your work

465
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:37,039
for credit here there's another one

466
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,640
like this one it's going to re tell you

467
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,640
make sure your plot is computer

468
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,280
generated no hand plots i'm not going to

469
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,000
accept any hand plots you get no credit

470
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,039
okay so i will also put up a short video

471
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,760
on

472
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,240
using excel to make plots of functions

473
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,120
so that

474
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,880
that will help you out with this problem

475
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,440
all right

476
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,640
so that's where your homeworks will be

477
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,160
but this is a great place if you're

478
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,799
running into trouble

479
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,559
let's say you are trying to plot this

480
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,559
and you're having some kind of an issue

481
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,480
with excel

482
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,080
this is the place to go ahead and you

483
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,679
know highlight where you're having your

484
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,919
problem and enter your

485
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:18,559
question okay and then other students

486
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,360
can help feel free to help i would

487
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,960
rather you

488
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,480
be the ones to help each other i

489
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:30,400
hopefully i'll only come in to help if

490
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,960
either a no one is or b the discussion

491
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,880
uh gets off track and and you're all

492
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,960
confusing each other more but generally

493
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,760
you answer questions

494
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,640
many times better than i do so please

495
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,720
help each other

496
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,559
and helping each other goes right into

497
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,720
your

498
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,880
grading goes right into the perusal

499
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,919
grade okay keeps track of all sorts of

500
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,039
things

501
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,840
and some of those things are

502
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,360
responding to other students questions

503
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,280
so

504
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,039
so use this again to interact with each

505
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,480
other and

506
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,840
interacting with me if you

507
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,360
click on the this one here this will

508
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,679
show you

509
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,799
all of the comments that are currently

510
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,799
here called conversations

511
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,480
you can use this to just show your own

512
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,400
comments

513
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,840
and you can look at the other options

514
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,960
here but

515
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,480
i'll usually leave it on all comments

516
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,440
you can see the homeworks that are kind

517
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,440
of hashtagged

518
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,520
so far okay and then as we move

519
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,240
out of this section into the next

520
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,320
sections

521
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,880
down here this will start to move

522
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,840
into your text that's summary pages take

523
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,480
a look at those

524
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,480
very useful

525
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,360
resources all right finally i think

526
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,360
we're getting to the text part

527
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,679
most likely since it's taken a second

528
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,360
there we go so

529
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,840
when you get into the text part then

530
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,840
you'll find

531
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,400
conversations from myself and from other

532
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,320
students so

533
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,919
um and many times i'll put in here like

534
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,120
in chapter one i'll say just go ahead

535
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,919
and skim

536
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,360
or as we go on i'll say skip this uh

537
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,480
particular section you don't need to

538
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,520
worry about this so

539
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,360
i will comment throughout that way and i

540
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,880
might make some clarifying comments

541
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,480
as you can look through you'll see on

542
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,480
the bond energy stuff

543
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,520
i put those in there to try and clarify

544
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,600
some

545
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,600
typical problems that come up

546
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,000
all right so again make sure that you

547
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,039
are commenting on each other's

548
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,799
and commenting on the text

549
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,159
if you uh if you like to read hard

550
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,400
copies um

551
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,840
you can get some hard copies you can get

552
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,960
an old edition

553
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,159
pretty cheap feel free to do that

554
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,320
what you're going to want to do though

555
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,400
is use this perusal as your way of

556
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,600
interacting with the class

557
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,679
and this is where you're going to get

558
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,880
graded so you can put in

559
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,720
questions that you have when you're

560
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,440
doing your own reading you could

561
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,159
highlight

562
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,919
and you know make a comment about things

563
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,520
that you think are important

564
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,760
or you can read through other students

565
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,039
comments and

566
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,440
comment to those you can upvote you can

567
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,080
ask

568
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,080
me questions so all sorts of ways of

569
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,840
interacting with the text that'll all go

570
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,840
into your grade

571
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,159
all right the hashtags over here on the

572
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,600
bottom left so again if here is the

573
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,240
easiest way to get your homework

574
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,840
assignments

575
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,919
instead of scrolling through just hit

576
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,520
hashtag homework

577
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,440
and as i keep going through all your

578
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,919
chapters it all show up here but there's

579
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,840
your

580
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,679
homeworks for chapter two

581
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,840
all right you can also look under

582
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,280
hashtag instructor

583
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,600
uh everything that i type into

584
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,320
perusal i will hashtag with instructor

585
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,480
so that's

586
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,880
one place you can see that and

587
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,000
if it's particularly a clarifying

588
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,720
question i might

589
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,640
hashtag it with a clarification so those

590
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,559
are just sometimes helpful hints

591
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,640
for you and if it's a

592
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,120
section that you can just skim i'll put

593
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,360
a hashtag skim on it

594
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,760
okay so you can take a look at those

595
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,120
so use those hashtags and you can use

596
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,360
the hashtags in

597
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,679
your own comments so feel free to

598
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,620
hashtag if you want

599
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,840
you can i guess use the at and

600
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,679
[Music]

601
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,919
direct things to one of your fellow

602
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,400
students and you can use it to direct

603
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,600
stuff to me that you want to make sure

604
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,200
that i that i see

605
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,159
once we start getting a lot of comments

606
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,159
going on on here

607
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,760
all right so that's

608
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,000
your assignments there also be a library

609
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,600
right

610
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,760
now it just has your course text in it

611
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:04,159
but i will put in here the pdf versions

612
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,360
um of the slides that go along with your

613
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,320
lecture

614
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,640
video lectures so feel free to comment

615
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,880
uh

616
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,480
on the slides if you have questions

617
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,200
there and

618
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,080
i or other students can also address

619
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,360
those

620
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:23,039
there as well all right

621
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,600
so that is perusal again it's to

622
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,400
try and keep up the interaction uh

623
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,840
between you

624
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,320
and me um on this online environment

625
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,960
and so please take advantage of it and

626
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,440
um

627
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,080
you know i look forward to to seeing all

628
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,720
of your

629
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,880
comments and and commenting with to you

630
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,880
all

631
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,520
okay so let's go ahead and we'll jump

632
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,640
back over to um

633
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,720
canvas and just want to

634
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,960
point out the instructor policy guide so

635
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,919
you can see what my grading scale looks

636
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,400
like

637
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,480
and the waiting i've got homework at 10

638
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:03,039
perusal at 10.

639
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,440
45 for your exams there's three of those

640
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,000
you have a research paper due and that's

641
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,279
we'll talk about on friday

642
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,799
and you have a final exam so this is the

643
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:17,440
waiting and hopefully that adds to 100.

644
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,000
read through the honor system stuff all

645
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,600
the standard

646
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,080
sorts of things related to the the honor

647
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,799
system

648
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,120
so you go ahead and do that since this

649
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,080
is completely online course

650
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,520
we don't have to worry about the covid

651
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,600
and social distancing and

652
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,600
mask wearing so i won't talk about

653
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,360
all of that in these these interesting

654
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,960
times

655
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,600
all right so that's the instructor's

656
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,600
policy guide

657
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,159
okay if we jump over to the

658
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,960
announcements again

659
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,159
it's the assignment clarification i just

660
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,080
wanted to point out

661
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,440
the many of the things i was telling you

662
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,760
about perusal

663
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,440
is written at the bottom there and so

664
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,360
these are all the sorts of things that

665
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,640
are graded

666
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,760
in perusal for your grades

667
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,880
okay so starting reading

668
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,720
early and looking through the

669
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,480
the textbook throughout the week or

670
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,240
whenever this assignment is is due

671
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,200
rather than waiting to the last minute

672
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,760
is actually taken

673
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,880
up into your account into your grade so

674
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,400
if you're trying to cram all your

675
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,559
reading and your

676
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,000
comments in on the last day the hour

677
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,200
before it's due

678
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,600
it will penalize you okay so

679
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,440
again the idea is to interact and you

680
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,279
can't interact with each other

681
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,240
if you're doing it at the last minute

682
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,400
okay and so

683
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,279
we need to spread out your reading and

684
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,559
your commenting

685
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,360
in working on the class daily and that

686
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,400
will help

687
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,840
with your grade so break your reading

688
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,080
into chunks

689
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,840
and you know comment with your fellow

690
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,720
classmates

691
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:03,919
answering questions from others accounts

692
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,600
you asking questions that elicit

693
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,960
comments or responses from other

694
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,120
students help

695
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,760
also your grade as well as theirs for

696
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,400
answering

697
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,320
up voting there's you know some small

698
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,400
amount for upvoting so don't go crazy up

699
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,320
voting everything just

700
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,679
trying to pick up your grade but but do

701
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,880
upload things that are that are

702
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,120
important all right

703
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,080
um if you start to feel like you're not

704
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,679
finding

705
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,760
things to comment on because it seems

706
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,799
like everyone has commented then

707
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,200
you might not be reading early enough so

708
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,840
again get in there and and get your

709
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,840
reading done

710
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,400
all right well i think that is

711
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,960
everything i hope um i'm sure i missed

712
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:51,520
some stuff so feel free to uh

713
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:54,000
to email me um or to post questions

714
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,600
where appropriate in perusal and i can

715
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,840
try and help you

716
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,960
i think what 26 minutes that this video

717
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,360
is a little bit longer

718
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,240
i will generally try and keep all of the

719
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,799
videos

720
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,159
you know hopefully it's sort of the 10

721
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,279
maybe 15 at the most

722
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,880
minutes and so in the chapters i'll try

723
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,440
and

724
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,919
make the videos on topical so there

725
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,880
might be

726
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,919
three or four videos in a chapter but

727
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,559
i'll make them

728
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,440
specific to specific topics in that

729
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,440
chapter that

730
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,200
typically students have a difficult time

731
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,600
with

732
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,360
okay well again i look forward to

733
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,240
interacting with you all

734
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,000
i know i can't do it face to face we we

735
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,600
could have some zoom meetings

736
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,279
if you want for office hours or

737
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,120
something like that we can set those up

738
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,240
one-on-one

739
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,240
i can do that as a class so we can see

740
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,600
how things go

741
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,080
or we can just interact through the

742
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,679
perusal i really do enjoy

743
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:55,200
uh reading your comments and

744
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:58,240
interacting with you that way so

745
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,320
all right well enjoy the semester uh

746
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:06,720
stay safe and

747
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,720
get to work
