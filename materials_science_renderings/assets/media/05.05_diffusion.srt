1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,960
all right welcome back to

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,320
part five i believe uh we are on now

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,960
we're going to take a look at the

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,880
non-steady state diffusion case

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,000
so we're going to predict the

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,880
concentration

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,840
in a material under the conditions where

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,160
we no longer

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,560
have this linear concentration gradient

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,680
like we saw in fixed first law

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,359
so we're going to end up using what's

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,720
called fixed second law in this case

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,600
so if we take fick's first law

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,320
and we apply to it a conservation of

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,120
mass

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,960
which is that the concentration in time

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,440
is equal to

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,280
the negative of the gradient of the flux

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,879
with position

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,719
and charles is trying to explain what

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,120
that is here in this picture in a second

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,039
but if we go ahead and combine those

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,399
then we'll go ahead and we'll get

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,440
fixed second law so dc dt is equal to

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,920
the derivative

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,640
of j which is fixed first law so take

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,160
the derivative of that with respect to x

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,040
and so i'll get the second derivative

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,680
here of concentration with position

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,119
and we made the assumption that d did

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,760
not depend on position

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,439
so that was pulled out front okay and

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,880
that's not always the case but it'll be

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,439
the case for the problems that we're

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,320
looking at here

36
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,439
all right so let's see if we can kind of

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,320
get to this

38
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,439
mass balance equation a little bit so

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,240
let's say that this

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,439
is represents a concentration profile

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,000
through our solid

42
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,720
okay so we have some surface value the

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
concentration falls off in our solvent

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,280
and then eventually it plateaus to this

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
value c0

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,439
which is the initial value of the

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,439
concentration

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,240
okay so maybe this is a steels and it

49
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,240
already has carbon in it that's my c0

50
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,200
value

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,000
and i put it in an environment rich in

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,159
carbon so that

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,079
i can bring my surface up to some higher

54
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,640
value and harden it

55
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,880
and then i apply heat and time to allow

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,320
that carbon to start diffusing in

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,920
to my steel okay so initially

58
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,800
i don't have any of the new carbon in

59
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,000
and then later time t1 it's starting to

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,280
move in

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,480
t2 t3 i'm moving even further in

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,200
to my solid all right so let's just take

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,959
a look at this

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,800
t2 curve here and look at this one point

65
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,080
if i go ahead and just draw a little box

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,800
here around this

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,200
one point represented as here

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,280
i can ask so this represents a point in

69
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,840
my material

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,879
so at this particular position i've got

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,080
a flux coming

72
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,920
in to this piece of material

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,120
and i'll have a flux that's also leaving

74
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,440
this base of material

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,440
and what i want to do is see which one

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,120
of these fluxes is bigger

77
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,879
so if i just take a look at the slope

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,360
here right because fixed first law

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,360
says dc dx the slope's what's important

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
what i can find is that the slope is

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,239
steeper on this side

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,760
than it is on this side right see how

83
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,440
the slope is becoming

84
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,480
less and less steep and so my flux is

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,680
actually bigger coming

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,239
in than it is leaving

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,400
and the difference in these fluxes over

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,040
the time step

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,760
and it's coming in an area then gives me

90
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,840
a kilogram

91
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,760
and so that tells me how much my

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,239
concentration then in this volume

93
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,599
has to increase with whatever that time

94
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,680
step is

95
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,720
so my little volume element the

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,959
concentration goes up with my time step

97
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,840
and it goes up by the difference in the

98
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,200
flux

99
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,599
across this location so that's dj dx

100
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,840
so that's kind of the physical idea of

101
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,599
how that works

102
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,879
since the flux coming in is larger than

103
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,720
the one leaving

104
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,120
then ultimately the concentration goes

105
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,040
up in this little volume element

106
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,959
and so at a later time t my value is

107
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,599
going to be higher so i get up here to

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,799
my t3 curve

109
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,360
okay so that's the idea but anyway we

110
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,080
get fixed second law

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,560
and we would need to solve that second

112
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,280
order differential equation

113
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,840
for whatever the conditions were for the

114
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,680
particular diffusion case that we had

115
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,639
so let's say that we were diffusing

116
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,440
copper into a bar of aluminum so this is

117
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,560
an aluminum bar i have copper here

118
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,080
on the surface and i'm going to diffuse

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,400
it into this surface

120
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,680
and then diffuse it this way one

121
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,960
dimensionally down the bar

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,479
so my surface concentration cs of

123
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,600
copper is shown here in this plot

124
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,120
okay so that's my surface i could have

125
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,000
some initial value

126
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,520
so that's represented out here i had

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,919
infinity here

128
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,199
my copper hasn't reached that far so

129
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,240
that's just my initial

130
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,840
to continue this on

131
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,840
and then with time we're going to end up

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,600
with these profiles as i move

133
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,520
more and more copper into this material

134
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,919
so my initial and boundary conditions

135
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,199
are that at time equals zero

136
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,680
i have an initial value for all x

137
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,360
and then at time greater than zero i set

138
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,840
my surface

139
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,360
to some fixed value that's x equals zero

140
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,400
for the surface

141
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,360
and i still maintain my c zero value

142
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,600
when x is equal to infinity okay so that

143
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,160
just says over the time frame of

144
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,199
my problem i never reached the other

145
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,440
side

146
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,919
so this doesn't have to be an infinite

147
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,919
thickness it just needs to be

148
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,919
thick relative to my time frame

149
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,759
so if i was to go ahead and solve those

150
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,440
differential equations

151
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,680
i'd end up with this error function

152
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,479
solution

153
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,479
shown here and in fact this is a fairly

154
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,639
simple problem if we start moving the

155
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,479
boundary conditions initial conditions

156
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,720
away from this one we'll find that we

157
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
can't solve them anymore analytically

158
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,919
and then we'd have to move into

159
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,680
numerical solutions

160
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,039
but this one we can so this is referred

161
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,319
to as a semi-infinite diffusion problem

162
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,600
this error function is a function that

163
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,280
you'll find in excel

164
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,319
matlab or mathematica sometimes on your

165
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,560
calculator

166
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,520
this is the definition of it but you're

167
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,880
not going to have to

168
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,199
do that what we're going to do is

169
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,960
calculate this value in here

170
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,560
and then just find the error function

171
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,680
like we would find the sine or

172
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,039
cosine or anything else this is my

173
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,039
concentration profile as a function of

174
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,039
position and time

175
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,160
my initial value and this is my surface

176
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,160
concentration value

177
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,759
so if i'm given uh say a diffuse

178
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,840
diffusion coefficient

179
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,560
and i'm given a particular time that i'm

180
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,759
interested in maybe one hour

181
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,240
i could calculate then the concentration

182
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,039
as a function of position that's what

183
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,039
these curves are

184
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,599
all right um this error function is also

185
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,000
tabulated so here is actually tabulated

186
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,039
value

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,319
for it so if you were to find

188
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,360
this x over 2 square root dt value

189
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,000
and then we'll just call this z

190
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,800
that's the z here you can look up the z

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,479
value

192
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,720
and go across and there's your error

193
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,000
function so the other function you can

194
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,120
see goes from zero

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,599
to one so after about 2.8 you can just

196
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,160
call it one and it stays

197
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,160
at one

198
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,639
so let's take a look at a quick example

199
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,840
so here we've got a an iron

200
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,599
carbon or steel it has initially 0.28

201
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,280
percent carbon in it that's my c

202
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:02,479
zero uh surface concentration

203
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,599
is at one that's my cs

204
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,680
my time is 49.5 hours i need to put that

205
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,560
in seconds

206
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,639
and the concentration now it's telling

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,759
us it's 0.35

208
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,400
at a position x equals to 4. so they're

209
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,319
actually giving us this one

210
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,759
and they're giving us the position

211
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,240
so what they haven't given us in this

212
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,919
case is actually the diffusion

213
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,800
coefficient

214
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,240
so that we can solve for and it wants to

215
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,399
know what the temperature of it

216
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,719
is that this was carried out okay well

217
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,880
there's no temperature in this equation

218
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,000
but recall that the temperature is in

219
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,599
the equation for

220
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,600
this so once we find d

221
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,040
and then if we're given the

222
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,880
pre-exponential and the

223
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,640
uh that's d0 and we're given the

224
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,320
activation energy q

225
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,600
then we could find t

226
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:02,560
so here's my equations my knowns

227
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,560
i'll go ahead and plug in okay

228
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,320
and this particular case i don't know d

229
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,440
so i can't calculate this and then go to

230
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,720
my table

231
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,600
i have to use my table in reverse i know

232
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,560
these values right here

233
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,720
so i can bring that one over here and

234
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,959
that'll all be

235
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:27,040
0.8125 so my error function

236
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,959
z is equal to the 0.8125

237
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,080
so then i could go to my table or my

238
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,080
calculator

239
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,080
and solve for what z gives me this

240
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,000
so i might have to do a little

241
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,040
interpolation

242
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,600
and i'll get a z of 0.93 and then

243
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,200
remember

244
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:50,240
z is this term x over 2 square root dt

245
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,440
i can solve for d everything else is

246
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,800
given

247
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,080
i get 2.6 times 10 to the minus 11

248
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,800
meters squared per second

249
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,079
and then the last step which i don't

250
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,920
have one here

251
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,839
is if i go ahead and look in the table

252
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,200
in your text you'll see a value for the

253
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,880
activation energy and the

254
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,360
pre-exponential

255
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,760
for carbon in iron you can use that

256
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,440
with the equation for the diffuse for

257
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,640
the diffusion coefficient

258
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,560
and you could calculate what the

259
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,959
temperature has to be to give you this

260
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,959
value

261
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,880
all right that was a mouthful so just a

262
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,240
little summary for you

263
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,079
generally diffusion is faster for more

264
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,320
open crystal structures

265
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:40,560
so that means lower density materials

266
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,560
or another way of saying it is low

267
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,079
atomic packing factor

268
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,959
okay so you expect the fusion to be

269
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,760
faster say for a body centered cubic

270
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,800
versus a face centered cubic material if

271
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,800
everything else is equal

272
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,600
materials with weaker bonds allow things

273
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,240
to move around them

274
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,399
much quicker than a material saying with

275
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,240
very strong bonds

276
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,320
that don't allow distortion of the

277
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,240
lattice so easily

278
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,920
smaller atoms tend to diffuse faster

279
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,360
than larger ones this was one of the

280
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,399
mechanisms for

281
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,480
interstitial diffusing diffusion moving

282
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,640
faster than vacancy

283
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,000
and then of course lower versus density

284
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,160
has to do with how much space is

285
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,200
available

286
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,200
in the unit cell or atomic packing

287
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
factor
