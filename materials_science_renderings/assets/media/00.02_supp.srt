1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,120
all right let's go ahead and do a quick

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:13,040
uh look at the gronta edupak

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,040
2020 while we load up here

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,760
all right so first thing we're going to

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,720
do is again select our database

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,400
i want to look at the advanced utility

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,199
and plotting

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,039
equations and in particular we're going

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,719
to be looking at this

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,079
second ces assignment where we want to

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,600
plot a bar chart

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:44,160
so let me go ahead and select the

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:47,360
elements for this one

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,320
going to try and fit our

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,440
ces in here all right so we're going to

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,960
go ahead and we select the elements

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,800
we're going to go ahead and

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,280
select chart like we've done before

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,799
and we're going to select here from the

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,799
elements so that's

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,040
that's all that we want we're going to

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,040
go ahead and do the chart index again

23
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,720
and and this is the same thing you would

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,479
do even if it wasn't the elements if it

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,439
was like a level one or something like

26
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,960
that

27
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,400
but in your particular homework problem

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,320
you're going to be needing to use the

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,520
elements database

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,840
so the next thing you want to do for a

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,200
bar

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,439
chart is to define the y-axis only

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,600
that's referred to as a bar chart in the

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,799
edupack software

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,600
and the x-axis will just be

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
something like element type it'll handle

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,040
that by

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,280
itself if you were to plot the

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,960
define the x-axis and the y-axis in

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,640
terms of properties you end up with

41
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,159
what's called a bubble chart

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
and that's what you've done before so

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,680
let's go ahead and do the bar

44
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,799
chart now if we're going to do an

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,680
equation

46
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,960
rather than just selecting one property

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,680
then we need to go into the advanced

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,399
okay then here we can we can write an

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
equation

50
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,920
so i'm not going to do the one that you

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,800
have for homework but let's say

52
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,319
that we wanted to take a look at let's

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,239
go do look at mechanical properties

54
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,400
so let's say that we wanted to look at

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,840
something like

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,560
1 minus so i'm just typing that in

57
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,080
okay but when i get to a property i have

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,840
to put it in

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,800
through an insert command so i need to

60
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,239
go to poisson's ratio for example if i

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,280
wanted that

62
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,040
and i have to say insert okay

63
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,400
then i can go ahead and type and close

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,239
my parentheses

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,239
i can't type these in i need to use the

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,560
insert command to get them right

67
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,920
so so far i've got one minus poisson's

68
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,480
ratio

69
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,840
and then maybe i want to divide that by

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,879
something like the

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,239
bulk modulus so again i'll do bulk

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,519
modulus

73
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,560
and then i'll say insert okay if for

74
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,920
some reason

75
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,879
i'm going to go back here to the

76
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,720
beginning i wanted to multiply the

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,640
the whole thing or the top here by

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,480
something like pi

79
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,480
then what i would do is go to my

80
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,080
constants

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,400
okay and then i would find pi

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,280
and i would insert it okay and again i'm

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,560
going to need the

84
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,879
multiply sign so i've got pi times 1

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,799
minus the poissons ratio divided by the

86
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,879
bulk modulus

87
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,400
okay this doesn't really make any sense

88
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,280
but that's that's just what we're going

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,560
to plot here just for fun

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,440
if you're doing something like an

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
exponential then you would go ahead and

92
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,799
use this

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,920
base of natural logarithm you'd insert

94
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,959
that

95
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,280
and then you can use the carrot here for

96
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,239
the

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,920
for the power okay just like you do in

98
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,400
excel

99
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,720
if you need the gas constant then you

100
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,720
can see the gas constant here

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,840
in joules per mole says degrees c

102
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,239
joules per mole kelvin this is the same

103
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,280
as

104
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,360
uh per kelvin the difference in

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,040
degree c and difference in kelvin are

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,159
the same

107
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,720
so that would be our gas constant or we

108
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,959
could do

109
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,040
the boltzmann's constant just depending

110
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,639
on on our units of our problem but

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,360
that's where you find all this stuff

112
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:26,000
is in your constants and parameters

113
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,720
all right so let's just go ahead and see

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,320
what we get

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,280
we'll go ahead and say insert

116
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,120
i should say just offhand unlike excel

117
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,040
there's no equal sign out front okay

118
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,720
we're just writing the equation in

119
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,160
all right so go ahead and say insert

120
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,160
whoops

121
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,720
i didn't want to insert sorry i wanted

122
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,280
to say okay

123
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,120
put that back so again pi times one

124
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,479
minus poisson so now i just say okay

125
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,960
and it titles my axis

126
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,479
according to the equation i just said

127
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,000
and then i'll just go ahead and say

128
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,080
ok again if i want to change the

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,600
axes i could certainly do linear versus

130
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,680
logarithmic or

131
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,600
or set min max but i'll say ok

132
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,280
and it gives me a bar chart so the

133
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,880
reason it's you can see it's called a

134
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,880
bar is because

135
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,639
it will give these little bars

136
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,960
for every element okay and it's not

137
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,160
labeling the elements on this axis but

138
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,919
this would be your

139
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,400
element axis each one of these

140
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,280
corresponds to an element

141
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,160
but since there's some standard

142
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,120
deviation

143
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,880
in the properties like a modulus and the

144
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,479
poisson ratio

145
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,919
that results in a little standard

146
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,759
deviation in

147
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,280
the value here that we calculate and

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,400
that's why there's a bar

149
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,240
it represents the range of values for

150
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,320
that particular element

151
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,160
and then again you can come over here

152
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,039
and you could click on one of these or

153
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,880
just

154
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,240
hover and you could see what elements

155
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,400
are what okay and you can always click

156
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,000
on one

157
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,160
if you wanted to do something like that

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and label it so there's aluminum

159
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,440
the other thing you can do if you were

160
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,880
looking for something specific

161
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,560
is you might not want to have to hover

162
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,520
over every one of these to try and find

163
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,280
it so

164
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,400
let's say we wanted to do iron

165
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,560
iron here we go what i can do is right

166
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,840
click on iron

167
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,600
and then i can say

168
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,720
highlight or i could do label

169
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,479
so let me just do highlight first so you

170
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,039
can see here the highlighted

171
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,120
it blinks kind of lets me know that that

172
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,319
there it is

173
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,360
and in this case it also labeled it

174
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,919
okay so if i want to do lead

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,280
again i could just say label and that

176
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,039
would do the same thing

177
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,319
puts a label on it i can see where that

178
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,199
is

179
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,680
all right so that's how we could do that

180
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,599
all right

181
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,599
i guess that's it for now
