1
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.919
okay so

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.800
last time we um talked a little bit

3
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.480
about

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.559
the different kinds of planes and i just

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.759
want to review that

6
00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.480
very briefly so here we have the face

7
00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.600
centered

8
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.520
cubic structure i've got a whole bunch

9
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.800
of unit cells remember

10
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.840
that this is the unit cell for it right

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.039
the smallest unit

12
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.760
for the structure and

13
00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.399
if i build up with multiple unit cells i

14
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.559
can build up my crystal

15
00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.719
what i wanted to just remind you i go

16
00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.840
ahead and show the

17
00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.600
face planes and these planes here the

18
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.039
one one ones

19
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.680
cut corners i just wanted to remind you

20
00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.520
that

21
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.879
the different kinds of planes that can

22
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.879
be sliced through the material have

23
00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.840
different orientations

24
00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.559
within the structure you can clearly see

25
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.559
that and

26
00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.280
that if i take a look at the planes

27
00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.280
themselves

28
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.680
that you can see they have different

29
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.760
packing different symmetry

30
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.360
we've got that square packing here for

31
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.560
the face

32
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.159
and we've got that hexagonal

33
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.880
packing here for the one one one

34
00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.320
type planes these again are the billiard

35
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.759
ball

36
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.759
type packing planes

37
00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.759
okay so let's go back to our

38
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.920
powerpoint presentation

39
00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.840
okay so we're back to our powerpoint

40
00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.600
presentation this is just what i showed

41
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.000
you when you take a look at the

42
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.200
slides okay again packing density

43
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.759
differences

44
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.520
and orientations so what we look at

45
00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.560
today is how to

46
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.880
uh explain or describe these plates

47
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.640
okay how do i come up with this calling

48
00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.399
this one

49
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.000
and calling this a one zero zero

50
00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.680
and these are referred to as builder

51
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.399
indices

52
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.040
and we'll go ahead and just jump right

53
00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.800
in

54
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.080
so first we're going to go ahead and

55
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.640
look at directions they're a little

56
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.120
easier

57
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.640
so we'd like to define specific

58
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.800
directions within a crystal

59
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.959
and then from there we'll define

60
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.959
specific planes in the crystal

61
00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.800
so the directions look a lot like just

62
00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.599
defining vectors

63
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.680
that you're used to doing from math

64
00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.640
except now everything again is relative

65
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.760
to

66
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.680
the uh the unit cell so here's the steps

67
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.000
so all we got to do is just follow these

68
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.120
steps through

69
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.720
uh one by one and you should be fine so

70
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.239
first thing first we'll define our

71
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.680
coordinate system and in this figure

72
00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.440
it's already defined for us

73
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.440
there's our x y and z directions

74
00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.720
if we go ahead and pick uh

75
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.720
let's say we're going to go ahead and

76
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.760
take a look at this direction here

77
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.400
what we want to do is grab the

78
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.519
head coordinates for the head fractional

79
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.200
coordinates

80
00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.159
so that's one one one

81
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.800
in this case i'm going to go ahead and

82
00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.560
subtract off the tail

83
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.640
which in this case is at our origin

84
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.200
already so

85
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.760
step isn't doing much i'm going to get 1

86
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.280
1 1

87
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.879
back again okay if i had fractions i

88
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.000
would clear them

89
00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:31.360
by multiplying through by the

90
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
least common denominator and that i

91
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.280
would reduce

92
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.040
to the smallest integers if if in this

93
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.560
case i'm already reduced

94
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.959
i have no fractions then my final step

95
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.720
which is critical and you'll lose a lot

96
00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.319
of points if you don't

97
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.440
obey this is to enclose the numbers

98
00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:56.720
in square brackets

99
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.720
okay without commas

100
00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.439
so i'm going to write that nice and

101
00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:08.159
big no commas when you're describing the

102
00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.840
indices and that's also true for planes

103
00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.000
okay parentheses and commas

104
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.599
are for coordinates just like you do in

105
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.239
math that's fine

106
00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.560
but when you're describing a direction

107
00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.880
you do not use

108
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.320
comma so let's go ahead and take a look

109
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.520
at what happens if we

110
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.840
maybe do get some fractions or we do

111
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.840
have negative signs

112
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.040
so let's go ahead and take a look at one

113
00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.040
of these

114
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.040
we'll go ahead and take a look at that c

115
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.639
here

116
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.880
okay so for c again we're going to take

117
00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:50.160
the head in this case that's down here

118
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.600
and so we're going to go two thirds

119
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.120
in the x direction and it's on the x

120
00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.320
axis that's zero in the y

121
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.320
zero into z i'm going to subtract off

122
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.320
the tail

123
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.720
which is one third out in the x

124
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.680
it's all the way out in the y all the

125
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.080
way out

126
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.440
into z and so i'm going to get one third

127
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.600
minus one minus one okay

128
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.880
my next step was to clear fractions

129
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.919
so what i'm going to do is

130
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:32.479
take this and multiply by 3.

131
00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:35.600
so i'm going to get 1 minus 3 minus 3.

132
00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:38.240
and then i'm going to enclose this in

133
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.400
square brackets no commas

134
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.759
and the negative signs go on top of the

135
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.800
numbers

136
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.720
so this is read as a one three bar three

137
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.479
bar direction

138
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.120
right again no commas

139
00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.479
negative signs over top of the numbers

140
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.319
and make sure that your

141
00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:01.520
integers that you have are um

142
00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.479
the smallest for that direction so for

143
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.840
example if

144
00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:09.039
if i did this and i ended up with a two

145
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.360
six bar eight direction then i would

146
00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.280
reduce that to a one

147
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.120
three bar four right just dividing them

148
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.400
all by two

149
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.440
all right so that's a one three bar

150
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.000
three bar direction okay so hopefully

151
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.120
that's

152
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.160
not too bad go ahead

153
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:33.520
and take a second to do

154
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:36.400
a and i would pause the video here

155
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.600
go ahead and do a then come back and

156
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.240
we'll take a look

157
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.240
at the answer

158
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.520
okay welcome back let's go ahead and

159
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.280
take a look at the answer for a and see

160
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.759
how you did

161
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.479
so let's see again i'm going to go ahead

162
00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.479
and take my

163
00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:04.400
my head of this this is going to be zero

164
00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:07.919
one one take the tail

165
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.960
which is two-thirds zero

166
00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:14.880
one right i'm subtracting that

167
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:17.840
but i get minus two-thirds one-half

168
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.840
zero

169
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.199
i'll go ahead and multiply through now

170
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.199
by six

171
00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:31.440
and so i'm going to get minus four

172
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.759
three zero and then i'm going to enclose

173
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.639
that

174
00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:35.680
in square brackets put the negative sign

175
00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:38.880
over top

176
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:42.319
and no commas that's a four bar

177
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.000
three zero direction

178
00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:46.000
all right so let's go ahead hopefully

179
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.479
did that did that well

180
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.280
let's go get some practice all right so

181
00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:52.319
let's go ahead

182
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:55.759
and take a look at the uh

183
00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:57.280
indices for plane b now we're gonna take

184
00:07:55.759 --> 00:08:00.400
a look at planes these are different

185
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:04.560
steps here we have to walk through so

186
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.680
for plane b what i want to do is i want

187
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.520
to take

188
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:13.120
and find the fractional intercepts

189
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:16.160
with the a b and c axes and it has to

190
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.800
intercept the axes and can't

191
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.319
intercept the axes at a different part

192
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.879
of the unit cell it has to actually

193
00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:26.160
intercept the axes themselves so

194
00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:29.120
i'm going to intercept the a axis here

195
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.360
b axis here and then we'll deal with the

196
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.479
c

197
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:35.279
in a second so first let's go ahead and

198
00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:37.200
write down the intercept point so one

199
00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:39.279
half for the a

200
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.000
one third for the b instead of writing

201
00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:44.640
it up here for you to see

202
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.200
and this plane is parallel to the b

203
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.519
direction

204
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.519
right so the appropriate thing here when

205
00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:55.440
it's parallel

206
00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:59.200
is to put the intercept as infinity

207
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:02.320
this is an arbitrary this is the limit

208
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.959
um of the this is the intercept limit as

209
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.000
the plane

210
00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:08.000
becomes parallel so if you want imagine

211
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.760
that plane b

212
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.080
is not quite parallel to the z-axis but

213
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.440
it

214
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:19.279
has a very very slight tilt right

215
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:21.040
towards the z-axis

216
00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:23.440
okay so it's tilted just ever so

217
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.279
slightly towards the z axis

218
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.040
then the intercept with the z-axis is

219
00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:30.000
going to be

220
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.519
right some number that's very very large

221
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.839
and as this plane

222
00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:35.519
tilts less and less it becomes more and

223
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:37.200
more parallel

224
00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:39.440
then that intercept value is going to

225
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.880
keep going up right so in the limit of

226
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.240
it reaching parallel

227
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.080
the intercept is actually infinity

228
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.080
so if you don't like that just take it

229
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.120
as the convention

230
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.200
all right so that's our first step uh

231
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.760
step two take the reciprocals

232
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.240
so this is two three reciprocal of

233
00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.399
infinity is zero

234
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.360
if we had fractions we would again clear

235
00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:03.279
them

236
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.560
in case of planes we don't reduce the

237
00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:09.279
result your text says to reduce

238
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.440
and so that's fine if you do but you

239
00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:13.279
don't need to with planes

240
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.200
and then we'll close the set in

241
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:18.480
parentheses

242
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.880
and key is no commas

243
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.560
this is especially important for planes

244
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.680
because if you put commas in

245
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.720
then you've just given a coordinate all

246
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.680
right

247
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.680
so that's plane b

248
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:38.959
so what about uh for plane a

249
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.560
so i'm gonna go ahead again um pause the

250
00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:43.519
video if you like

251
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:46.079
and see what you get here for plane a

252
00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:48.399
and then come back and we'll take a look

253
00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:48.399
at it

254
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.440
all right welcome back let's go ahead

255
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.680
and look at a a

256
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.120
if you tried it has a little bit of a of

257
00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.880
a problem that we've gotta

258
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:02.160
gotta fix here okay so

259
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.680
with a we're going to have to find the

260
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.880
fractional intercepts let's go ahead and

261
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.240
do that

262
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:12.560
so it intersects the x-axis here

263
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:16.320
the a-axis at one it intersects the b

264
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:19.760
or axis here at one now what about the c

265
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.480
axis i needed to intercept the

266
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.800
c axis it's not good enough that it

267
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.640
intersects this point out here

268
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.560
although that's useful information for

269
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.200
us so what i'm going to need to do is

270
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.040
extend the plane

271
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.320
right so this plane is coming up out of

272
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.440
the board

273
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.519
and reaching this corner so from the xy

274
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.920
bottom plane i'm basically coming

275
00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:46.640
out halfway distance i'm going up a full

276
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.680
unit cell so that means if i was to go

277
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.560
the other way

278
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.560
i'm going to go down

279
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.720
all the way to my z axis

280
00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:58.480
and instead of coming up one i'm going

281
00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.600
to go down one

282
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.600
so this will hit here at minus one right

283
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.720
so there's my plane

284
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:11.440
extending down the z axis

285
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:14.880
until i intercept here at minus one

286
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:18.959
so that is my intercept

287
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:21.040
uh reciprocals here that step is uh

288
00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:22.639
obviously not doing anything in this

289
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.639
case

290
00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:29.200
i don't have any uh fractions to clear

291
00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:30.320
so i'm going to close in parentheses no

292
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.079
commas

293
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.320
and the negative sign must go over the

294
00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:37.120
top and this is read as a one

295
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.560
one one bar plane so this is actually

296
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.480
one of those billiard ball packing

297
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.240
planes we've been talking about

298
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.160
in this particular case it's it's sort

299
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.079
of slicing and cutting off this corner

300
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.160
if you want

301
00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:50.160
all right well good job
