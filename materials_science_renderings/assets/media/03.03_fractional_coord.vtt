1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.199
so let's go ahead and look at the point

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.720
coordinates

3
00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.040
so in point coordinates we're going to

4
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.080
write the fractional coordinates of the

5
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.120
atoms

6
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.240
relative to the unit cell so

7
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.280
here we've got a simple cubic unit cell

8
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.480
and one other thing we're going i need

9
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.880
to do to write the fractional

10
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.119
coordinates is just to go ahead and pick

11
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.960
a set of axes to use i'm going to

12
00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.560
go ahead and use this back corner and

13
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.199
i'll typically do that through most of

14
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.519
the slides

15
00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.920
try and be consistent for you i'm going

16
00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.200
to call these the abc

17
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.520
directions xyz

18
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.360
if you want the abc is typically how we

19
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.040
refer to the directions

20
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.440
on crystal systems so we can talk about

21
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.160
there being an a lattice parameter

22
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.640
b lattice parameter and c lattice

23
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.160
parameter in the case of the cubic the a

24
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.079
b and c are all equal and that wouldn't

25
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.480
be the case say for the tetragonal

26
00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.359
system that you saw previously

27
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.320
in that system the a and b are equal and

28
00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.519
the c-axis

29
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.360
is the one that is stretched

30
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.360
okay so at this point once we've got

31
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.400
that defined we can simply go ahead and

32
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.080
write

33
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.000
the positions of these coordinates

34
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.080
relative to

35
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.680
to this unit cell and so for example

36
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.040
this atom up here

37
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.360
would be zero in the a direction one in

38
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.080
the b

39
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.439
direction and one in the c direction so

40
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.439
just like you would normally write

41
00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.799
coordinates a point

42
00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.640
so this would be 1 1 1 for example as a

43
00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:39.040
coordinate

44
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.320
this one over here would be 0 1 0

45
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.000
right this one would be uh

46
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.000
one one zero

47
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.079
and then this one i'm gonna go ahead and

48
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.040
pause for a second

49
00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.560
a few times i like to think um just for

50
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.000
just for five seconds

51
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.640
what kind of coordinate would you write

52
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.640
for that one

53
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.320
all right so let's go ahead and see what

54
00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.840
you got

55
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.440
this should be the one zero

56
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.400
one okay so those are point coordinates

57
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.160
or fractional coordinates in our next

58
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.520
example here we've got

59
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.840
now atoms contained at other places

60
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.599
besides just the corners okay so we're

61
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.800
going to go ahead and do this

62
00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.920
in the same way if we describe the

63
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.480
positions again i'm going to use this as

64
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.599
my a

65
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.720
axis my b axis

66
00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.200
and then my c axis coming up along the

67
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.200
back here

68
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.360
that should be b um

69
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.560
so again these atoms that are sitting

70
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.120
out here on the corners

71
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:57.120
sample this one here would just be a one

72
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.879
one zero position and now for this face

73
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.680
centered cubic structure we've got adam

74
00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.720
sitting in the

75
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.239
centers of faces so

76
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.800
this face atom here then for example

77
00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.519
would be just one half of the way out in

78
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.519
the

79
00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.720
a direction one half over into b

80
00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.840
and we're in the a b planes is zero

81
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.440
in the see and so we'll see that all of

82
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.159
the face atoms have

83
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.360
similar type coordinates this one over

84
00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.040
here

85
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.840
we are a half out in the x

86
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.159
we are all the way out in the b

87
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.519
direction

88
00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.440
and then now one half up in the y

89
00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.560
direction

90
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.200
so that's how we can write our

91
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.120
fractional coordinates

92
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.640
all right so go ahead and think about

93
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.000
this one up here

94
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.680
go ahead and write down what you think

95
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.360
the coordinates for that will be i'll

96
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.360
give you just a few seconds to do that

97
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.720
okay so hopefully you saw that it was

98
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.239
one half out in the x direction

99
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.080
one half over in the y direction

100
00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.959
and one in the

101
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.079
z direction c direction so one half one

102
00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.079
half one

103
00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.919
is a fractional chord and so sometimes

104
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.400
this is very useful

105
00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.440
in uh helping to define where atoms are

106
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.639
when our structure

107
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.240
starts to get kind of confusing we also

108
00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.840
see that it's very helpful we're trying

109
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.960
to find

110
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.960
distances between planes

111
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:42.000
or distances between atoms to know their

112
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.919
fractional coordinates

113
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.280
all right so here's the cesium chloride

114
00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.880
structure

115
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.160
so i would go ahead and pause this video

116
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.639
now

117
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.479
and go ahead and write down the

118
00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.960
coordinates

119
00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.479
say for this atom this one

120
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.639
and this one so go ahead and pause the

121
00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.000
video

122
00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.759
write down the coordinates for those

123
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.400
three then come back

124
00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:12.880
and we'll take a look

125
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.479
okay welcome back let's go ahead and

126
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.160
write down the answers for these and see

127
00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:20.000
how you did

128
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.000
this is one half one half one half

129
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.680
this one here is going to be

130
00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:30.080
zero one

131
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.080
zero

132
00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.479
i guess i should have specified my axes

133
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.120
again i'm going to put them consistent

134
00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.560
with what i've been doing

135
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.360
okay if you pick a different coordinate

136
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.880
you're going to with different

137
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.919
fractional coordinates i recommend that

138
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.160
you pick

139
00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.960
the back corner like i am just make it

140
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.240
easier to

141
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:54.000
compare answers and then this one here

142
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:58.080
is going to be zero one

143
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.800
one okay

144
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.280
easy enough all right so let's go ahead

145
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.199
and take

146
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.479
a look at a little more complicated

147
00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.639
structure

148
00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.520
this is one that you saw before that we

149
00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.280
called diamond cubic

150
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.120
so this is a diamond cubic structure

151
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.000
when all of the atoms

152
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:20.720
here are the same type in this case here

153
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.680
these extra four atoms that show up in

154
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.520
this structure

155
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.160
um are not the same type but in fact

156
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.720
zinc and then sulfurs show up in what

157
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.080
look like

158
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.680
face centered cubic sites and so we've

159
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.360
got this what's called a zinc blend

160
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.720
structure

161
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.720
so fractional coordinates help here in

162
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.639
helping you to see where these extra

163
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.759
atoms are located

164
00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:46.639
so hopefully the sulfurs you can see

165
00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:49.440
are on face type sites so again

166
00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:53.199
something like this would be at one half

167
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.199
one one half

168
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.599
again i need to put my coordinate system

169
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.000
on here

170
00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:01.440
or these point coordinates don't make

171
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.080
any sense

172
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.160
okay we have no reference so there we go

173
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.000
we got abc

174
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.919
alright so now what about these extra

175
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.639
ones these these blue atoms that are

176
00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:14.479
here

177
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:17.680
each of these um zinc atoms

178
00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:21.199
are located behind a corner

179
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:25.039
and they're off by a factor of

180
00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:28.960
a quarter quarter quarter from a corner

181
00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:33.199
okay there's a mouthful so for example

182
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:36.560
if i was to take a look at this one here

183
00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:40.319
this corner atom is at one zero

184
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:44.639
zero and

185
00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:47.440
this zinc atom right

186
00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.080
it's going to be off from that let me go

187
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.360
ahead

188
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.639
and write its uh change in position so

189
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.400
i'm going to come

190
00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:57.919
back one quarter

191
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.680
so let me write it this way i'm going to

192
00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:04.080
write one zero

193
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.080
zero minus

194
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.599
uh let's see oops let me do plus

195
00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:15.039
okay so we're going to go minus a

196
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.240
quarter in the x direction

197
00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:20.960
and we're going to move over in the b

198
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.520
direction here by a quarter and we're

199
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.800
going to move

200
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.120
up by a quarter okay

201
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.720
so in other words the coordinate for

202
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.800
this one then

203
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:35.519
is three quarters one quarter

204
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.719
one quarter okay so they're all shifted

205
00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:41.440
by a quarter quarter

206
00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:45.440
quarter from their closest

207
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:47.120
corner atom so let's take a look at

208
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.360
one more of them so let's say this one

209
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.360
here

210
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:58.399
so the corner atom is sitting behind

211
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.399
it's at position one one one

212
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.640
and this one is shifted off by a quarter

213
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.120
quarter quarter

214
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.800
and so its position here in this case is

215
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.959
actually three quarters

216
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.959
three quarters three quarters

217
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.240
okay so that's the zinc blend um

218
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.240
structure

219
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:23.120
all right that's it for uh point

220
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.120
coordinates see you next time
