1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,800
the elastic modulus

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,800
is dependent upon temperature and you

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,599
can see that here in this plot

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,160
we also can see that for metals we're

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,160
looking at

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,720
elastic modulus values of hundreds of

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,960
gigapascals

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,840
and then you know aluminum may be down

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,800
at

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,320
70 gigapascals or something like that

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,320
which is also typical for

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,280
classes

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,239
now we learned about isotropic and

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,520
anisotropic properties before

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,640
the elastic modulus is also

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,760
a anisotropic property

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,480
it's a property that does depend on

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,480
direction and so

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,079
for the cubic system we have a simple

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,120
equation here

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,000
that says that we can find the elastic

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,520
modulus

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,359
in a uvw direction right this is just a

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,400
shorthand for saying that we're going to

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,200
pull

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,799
on our sample right in some direction so

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,439
if we're pulling along a diagonal that

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,400
would be a 1

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,439
1 1 direction or if we pull on the face

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,600
it might be like a one

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,360
zero zero direction so we're going to

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,840
pull it along a uvw

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,600
direction and if we know what the

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,799
elastic modulus

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,479
value is in the one zero zero

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,040
and then the 1 1 1 and so these are

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,320
tabulated we could go ahead and predict

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,640
from this equation

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,920
the elastic modulus in any uvw direction

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,000
all right i'll talk about these alpha

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920
beta gammas here in just a second

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,560
but the plot below is trying to show

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,360
this anisotropy effect

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,240
and so this plot here kind of represents

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,479
the

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,280
sample so imagine that this is aligned

47
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,680
with the

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:59,520
cubic unit cell and so if i was to

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,719
pull along a face right so that would be

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,000
pulling here on this front face and then

51
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,239
it would be out the back face the

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,440
length here from the center of this

53
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,800
image

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,760
to the surface represents

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,760
the magnitude of the elastic modulus so

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,599
this would be the smallest the lowest

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,920
value of the elastic modulus we have so

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,160
you can see it in color in terms of blue

59
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,239
and you can see it in terms of

60
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,599
the length from the center is not very

61
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,879
big in this case

62
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,879
say compared to pulling it along

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,400
a body diagonal right

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,640
in that case we're going from again the

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,360
center

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,640
all the way out to this surface so

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,879
that's the magnitude

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,480
you can see that's the the highest

69
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,800
magnitude we have in this figure that

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,840
would

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,720
represent the stiffest direction the

72
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,319
highest value of the elastic modulus

73
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,080
and so this kind of a plot is just

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,280
trying to show you

75
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,560
visually how much the

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,159
anisotropy is for given material

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,400
so if it was completely isotropic

78
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,159
then this would be a sphere so the

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,200
distance from the center to the sphere

80
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,159
surface would be everywhere the same

81
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,480
okay now let's talk about the alpha beta

82
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,480
gamma in case you need to get these

83
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:28,799
the alpha beta gamma are def are called

84
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,799
direction cosines

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,920
okay so they're defined as the cosine of

86
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,440
the

87
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,840
angle between the

88
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,760
uvw direction that you're pulling in

89
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:49,440
and one of our our axes our a b or c

90
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,480
axes so let's say that we're looking at

91
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,159
the

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,439
axis a which is one zero zero

93
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,560
this is the angle theta

94
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:04,239
and alpha is equal to

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,439
the cosine of theta and then

96
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:11,200
by dot product definition

97
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,480
right this is uvw

98
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,720
dotted with one zero zero so these are

99
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,919
the two vectors we have

100
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,759
and then that's over the magnitude of

101
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,639
uvw

102
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,800
and the magnitude of one zero zero which

103
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,800
of course is one

104
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,639
so if we're finding the alpha beta gamma

105
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,320
we just need to go ahead and perform

106
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,120
this dot product

107
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:40,000
and divide by the magnitude of the uvw

108
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,000
so hopefully you can guess that the beta

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,080
then would be the same equation except

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,440
that we would end up dotting with the

111
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:54,800
b direction right and the gamma

112
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,800
we would end up dotting with our c

113
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,000
direction

114
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,960
so hopefully you can so these would be

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,759
the magnitudes again

116
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,759
uvw

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,840
ugw all right

118
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,479
so you get the idea

119
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,080
and then the magnitude of these are

120
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,520
genji's one

121
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,680
all right so that's the beta and that's

122
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:25,600
the gamma

123
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:28,400
all right

124
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,639
so there's a nice plot of the change in

125
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,919
the young's modulus for a variety of

126
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,240
materials

127
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,120
as a function of the density of the

128
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,880
materials

129
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,720
plotting things against the density is a

130
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,400
real nice way of separating out a lot of

131
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,120
materials

132
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,080
in terms of their their families and

133
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,560
then these are also color coded

134
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,199
by uh the types of materials and you can

135
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,880
see that materials tend to cluster

136
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,960
so for example our you know our metals

137
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,520
and alloys are clustered

138
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,000
up here in this region are technical

139
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,199
ceramics

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,600
versus non-technical ceramics cluster a

141
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,840
little bit differently

142
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,080
so the non-technical might be glasses

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,360
technical might be

144
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,639
some kind of a titanium

145
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,120
oxide or zirconium based material for

146
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,120
example

147
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,880
polymers you can see that they are

148
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,160
clustering here

149
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,759
and then we've got elastomers those are

150
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,680
our rubbers

151
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,960
and as we move into the polymers chapter

152
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,120
which is going to be a

153
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,720
ways until we get there we'll see that

154
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,479
elastomers

155
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,759
are also polymers these are really

156
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,479
polymers but many times we'll separate

157
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,160
them out

158
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,840
just because they do behave so

159
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,560
differently from the general class of

160
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,080
polymers

161
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:56,639
all right and then we've got our foams

162
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,520
natural materials etc again so values

163
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,520
you're looking at

164
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,720
hundreds of right gigapascals up here

165
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,160
and then when you get to the polymers

166
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,720
you're looking at

167
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:16,400
something like gigapascal and elastomers

168
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,759
you're looking at what maybe 10

169
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,759
megapascals or so

170
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,479
all right so that is

171
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,759
it for this particular video and then

172
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,919
next time we're going to do is we're

173
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:36,560
going to go ahead and look at

174
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:39,120
some of the elastic constants

175
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,919
that we can define beyond just the

176
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,919
elastic modulus
