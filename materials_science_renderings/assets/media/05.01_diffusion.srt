1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,879
all right welcome to uh chapter five

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,040
diffusion in solids and today we

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,400
would like to address how diffusion

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,599
occurs

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,040
why it's important part of processing

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,840
how the rate of diffusion can be

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,400
predicted for some simple cases

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,119
and how the fusion depends on structure

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,119
and temperature

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,720
all right so first we want to make some

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,880
observations

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,000
so one of the things that we find is

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,040
that if we were to take

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,760
two different materials and bind them

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,879
together

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,160
so maybe this is a film

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,280
and deposit a different type of material

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,559
film on top and then we allow some time

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,480
to pass

20
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,239
and we were to heat this up especially

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,160
that will help the process

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,840
what we would find is that there is

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,120
inter diffusion

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,520
there is a movement of mass where the

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,600
gray atoms would move into the orange

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,439
and the orange would move into the gray

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,880
so we'd start to see that the interface

28
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,080
between them

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,280
becomes diffuse and this would continue

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,040
until we get

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,439
complete mixing so we we see that

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,880
that mass wants to move from high

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,159
concentration

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,159
to low concentration

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,960
now the other thing that we'll see is

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,720
that even if we were to use

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,920
one material and we were to go ahead and

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,520
radio tag some of the atoms in that

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,360
material

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,600
then and we were to wait some time and

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,040
measure the sample again what we would

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
find is that those atoms

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,040
have actually moved around in the sample

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,640
so what we're seeing here is what's

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,640
called self-diffusion

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,000
the main idea is that things are

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,680
constantly moving and

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,840
it doesn't depend on the fact that they

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,200
are different materials

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,360
so that concentration uh this difference

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,719
isn't what matters like things move

52
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,079
around even

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,160
when it's a single pure element

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,959
so our mechanism is going to need to

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,959
account for this

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,239
all right so what's missing in those

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,959
figures

58
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,280
well what's missing are point defects

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,599
vacancies in particular

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,360
so if i want to move mass around i need

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,920
somewhere for the atoms to be able to

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,959
move it

63
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,640
move into and we've seen that vacancies

64
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,560
are defects that are temperature

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,599
dependent

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,640
and so if i am to have a vacant

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,720
hole here in my lattice then any of the

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,400
neighboring atoms can simply move into

69
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,280
this space

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,400
okay and then that'll look as if the

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,560
vacancy has

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,080
shifted position any of those

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,280
neighboring atoms can then move into

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,959
that space

75
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,200
and then the vacancy looks like it's

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,480
shift position again and so this process

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,440
just keeps occurring

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,080
it's completely random and that random

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,640
process

80
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,560
results in a mixing and i'll show this

81
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,319
to you in a simple

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,080
kind of demonstration uh let's say a few

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,280
other things you want to say about this

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,760
this particular sketch makes it appear

85
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,560
as if any of these atoms would just fall

86
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,680
into the hole

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,519
there's no reason why this atom um

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,280
would stay here if it can move over into

89
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,920
this one in reality

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,360
this lattice is tighter and when there's

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,440
a vacancy here

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,640
this whole region will relax inward a

93
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,959
little bit

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,879
and so in order to move one of these

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,560
atoms into the hole

96
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,400
it will actually first have to kind of

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,400
push atoms out of the way

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
and so this means that there is an

99
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,879
energy barrier

100
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,640
for this process of diffusion okay

101
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,640
so we're going to get another arrhenius

102
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,920
equation like we saw

103
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,799
for the number of vacancies in this case

104
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,519
the radius equation is going to describe

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,840
the rate at which we get diffusion how

106
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,840
fast this process occurs

107
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,480
so let me go ahead and just show you

108
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,480
through a simple

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,879
model here that a random process will

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,760
result

111
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,199
in the movement of mass from one

112
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,079
material to another

113
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,240
so what we've got here is some material

114
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,280
in red and some material in blue

115
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,440
we've got some vacancies in the lattice

116
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,360
and what the computer simulation does is

117
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,560
it takes each vacancy

118
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,919
and it randomly decides that it moves up

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
down left to right and that's a

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,759
completely random process

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,040
and so you'll see that these vacancies

122
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,800
don't go very far

123
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,600
because it's not biased and so there's a

124
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,400
lot of repeating

125
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,919
so they're just hopping around randomly

126
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,000
and hopefully what you can start to see

127
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,840
is that there is some exchange here at

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,919
the interface we're starting to get some

129
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,840
blue moving to the red side

130
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,199
a little red moving over here to the

131
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,800
blue side

132
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,440
you can also see that this is a fairly

133
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,479
inefficient process so it takes a lot of

134
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,039
movement

135
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,720
ultimately a lot of vacancies to really

136
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,400
move things around

137
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,639
so if we run this simulation a little

138
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,800
longer and this one is the same

139
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,960
type of simulation we have more atoms

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,440
and in this one we're going to go ahead

141
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,680
and take slices of like every i think

142
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,479
hundred time steps or so

143
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,160
and so this will let us see longer times

144
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,680
and you can see now

145
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,199
the movement of the green and the red

146
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,840
into each other

147
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,280
and this is a concentration profile

148
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,840
across that sample

149
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,960
so you can see that interface spreading

150
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,440
out and becoming

151
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,400
more and more diffuse again completely

152
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,400
random process

153
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,160
and so that kind of explains our what

154
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,919
appears to be

155
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,280
the movement of mass from high

156
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,960
concentration

157
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,479
to low in terms of the red atoms

158
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,720
they would be at high concentration

159
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,720
moving to low into the green

160
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,360
all right so this process of vacancy

161
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,039
diffusion depends on the number of

162
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,000
vacancies that we have

163
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,840
so that's going to depend on temperature

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,759
and it depends on

165
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,720
the frequency of which atoms

166
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,319
actually hop into this space and that's

167
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,360
going to depend upon

168
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:29,360
the activation energy the barrier

169
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,360
for the diffusion process

170
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,840
now another mechanism of diffusion is

171
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,840
referred to as interstitial diffusion

172
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,880
here we're moving small atoms in a host

173
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,800
of larger atoms and we're moving the

174
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,880
atoms that exist in these interstitial

175
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,080
sites this might be carbon say

176
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,840
in iron and then this atom can now move

177
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,360
to any of the neighboring interstitial

178
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,440
sites

179
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,360
now at low concentrations which is

180
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,039
usually what we're talking about

181
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,120
all of the interstitial sites around

182
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,599
this one are open available

183
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,759
okay so this is one reason why

184
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,680
interstitial diffusion is faster than

185
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,680
vacancy diffusion

186
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,880
because this one already has its sites

187
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,960
available

188
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,840
where the vacancy diffusion mechanism

189
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,960
depends on the availability of a vacancy

190
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,479
the number that we have

191
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,319
all right now in this picture also it

192
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,800
looks as if this atom can just kind of

193
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,479
zip through here and in reality this

194
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,039
space is much smaller

195
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,479
these atoms are much closer and so these

196
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,800
guys have to actually move out of the

197
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,039
way before this one would be able to hop

198
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,000
into this site so there's an activation

199
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,400
barrier again

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,639
for this movement although it's smaller

201
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,560
than in the vacancy case

202
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,759
so the second reason that interstitial

203
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,160
diffusion

204
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,720
is faster than vacancy diffusion is

205
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,400
because typically small atoms

206
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:56,160
vibrate faster and move quicker

207
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,720
than larger atoms every time this atom

208
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,639
vibrates it's considered an attempt

209
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,919
at moving into one of its neighboring

210
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,080
sites

211
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,840
so if it's vibrating faster it's

212
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,639
attempting more often

213
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,919
and inevitably it'll get the right

214
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,639
conditions and then we'll hop

215
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,639
in to the next interstitial site

216
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,520
okay so that is the mechanisms

217
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,039
vacancy mechanism and interstitial

218
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,840
mechanism

219
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,479
and in the next video we're going to go

220
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,039
ahead and we're going to address

221
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,080
why we're even studying diffusion why is

222
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,719
this important

223
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,719
at all
