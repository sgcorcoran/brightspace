00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.960
okay welcome to the

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.280
second uh video in in uh chapter four

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.960
uh imperfections or defects in

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.759
crystalline solids

5
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.839
so we did the point defects last time

6
00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.279
and now we're going to uh move up in

7
00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.920
energy level

8
00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.359
so the point defects don't require a

9
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.439
whole lot of energy to form because

10
00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.480
we're only looking at

11
00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:29.359
a single atom kind of defect or maybe

12
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.640
a distortion a few atoms a distance from

13
00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.399
that

14
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.480
but now we're going to look at line

15
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.480
defects where we've got a whole

16
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.960
row of atoms that are involved

17
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.640
and then next time interfacial where

18
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.079
we've got a whole surface of atoms

19
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.399
involved okay so the energy

20
00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.559
level of these keeps going up and

21
00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.399
remember in terms of structures

22
00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.920
lower energy is always what we want

23
00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.440
lower energy is

24
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.719
the more stable configuration

25
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.000
all right so let's go ahead and talk

26
00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.399
about dislocations dislocations are

27
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
extremely important and we're going to

28
00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.600
take advantage

29
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.119
of controlling the numbers of

30
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.119
dislocations

31
00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.479
in a solid to improve mechanical

32
00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.000
behavior

33
00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:17.360
so it'll turn out that strengthening of

34
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.200
many uh metals and alloys can be done

35
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.000
through increasing the number of

36
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.000
dislocations in the original structure

37
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.520
so these defects actually result in a

38
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.799
strengthening

39
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.600
up to some point and then they create a

40
00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.920
brittle solid

41
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.960
which is then detrimental so we'll talk

42
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.560
about that more

43
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.600
in the chapters to come so for now let's

44
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.439
just see what a line

45
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.200
dislocation looks like so i've got a

46
00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.240
tem micrograph here on the left side

47
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.759
and this is at atomic resolution

48
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.960
essentially or just

49
00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.439
just before atomic resolution and what

50
00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.439
we're seeing here these lines

51
00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:04.640
these are actually dislocation lines

52
00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.080
so the way this instrument works

53
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.720
these bright regions are where the

54
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.920
x-ray beam the electron sorry the

55
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.760
electron beam

56
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.879
is able to penetrate through the sample

57
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.440
relatively easily and it results

58
00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.680
in a bright area the detector is sitting

59
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.280
behind the sample

60
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.120
and then the dark lines are where the

61
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.920
lattice is distorted

62
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.040
so this electron beam has trouble moving

63
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.239
through and so

64
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.160
it shows up dark and the

65
00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:39.840
dislocations are are lines of distortion

66
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.319
in the lattice so we can see them here

67
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.360
and so they do show up as lines that's

68
00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.760
why they're referred to as line defects

69
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.120
you can see there's a lot of them in

70
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.120
this

71
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.800
m micrograph remember this is now 51 000

72
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.200
x in the original micrograph that was

73
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.200
taken

74
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.080
so i want to talk about some theories

75
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.959
about

76
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.080
deformation so dislocations are going to

77
00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.800
be important

78
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.640
when you're thinking about plastic or

79
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.640
permanent deformation

80
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.400
that is when you take something and you

81
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.800
bend it into a new shape

82
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.760
you've plastically deformed permanently

83
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.000
deformed it

84
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.440
okay this is different from elastic

85
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.640
deformation

86
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.560
which is when you stretch something

87
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.840
and if you let go of the force it

88
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.040
returns to its original shape like a

89
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.040
spring

90
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.599
so in order for there to be permanent

91
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.440
deformation in our crystal structure

92
00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.120
you can imagine what has to happen is we

93
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.879
need to

94
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.599
move one part of the crystal

95
00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.799
relative to another part of the crystal

96
00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.879
we're showing this here at

97
00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.560
an atomic scale this has to happen all

98
00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.599
throughout our solid

99
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.799
but we need to move atoms from um

100
00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:02.239
one set of sites

101
00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:05.360
it was over here originally right

102
00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.400
over to another set of sites if i if i

103
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.080
only move them

104
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.040
part way so maybe here

105
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.720
and i let go of the force this would end

106
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.760
up just returning back to where it

107
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.639
started from

108
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.079
that would be some that would be elastic

109
00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.360
but if i can remove them

110
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.120
move them all the way over so that it

111
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.440
is forming the same crystal structure

112
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.520
again it's coming back into

113
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.440
the correct sites then this is permanent

114
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.800
there's no reason to go back

115
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.080
so i need to slide these planes of

116
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.720
crystals along each of me

117
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.960
now if this was the mechanism where i

118
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.560
have one set of planes that just slides

119
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.280
all together

120
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.040
over the other set of planes it turns

121
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.240
out that this would take

122
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.080
much much higher strengths

123
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.240
much much higher stress values than what

124
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.240
we see experimentally

125
00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.720
in fact this crystal if we did it this

126
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.639
way when it's status

127
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.240
this site here when it's maximum

128
00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.000
displacement

129
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.680
it's very close to the theoretical

130
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.520
strength of the material

131
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.080
and we would most likely end up with

132
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.080
fracture

133
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.919
so there's another way that this needs

134
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.680
to

135
00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.360
happen that was first speculate is

136
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.960
instead of trying to move the entire

137
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.840
crystal here

138
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.320
over top of the bottom one at one time

139
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.440
what if we were to just kind of move

140
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.400
a piece okay so what we did is we kind

141
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.320
of

142
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.720
pushed in a set of planes

143
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.320
okay and we've distorted this region

144
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.919
right in here

145
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.759
it looks like we've got an extra set of

146
00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.520
planes in our structure

147
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.360
but if i look up here the lattice looks

148
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.720
fine it's really

149
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.479
right in here where i've got the problem

150
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.320
so i've got too many atoms in this

151
00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.039
little region so

152
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.639
this is the distortion that that dm

153
00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.240
micrograph sees

154
00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.120
now remember this is coming in and out

155
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.120
of the board so it forms a line

156
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.520
but now all i got to do is move this

157
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.800
over one by one

158
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.720
and remove the whole crystal

159
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.840
so this is a much easier process takes

160
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.520
much less

161
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:19.039
stress this would be similar to

162
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.319
you moving say a 100 foot hose across

163
00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.560
your backyard

164
00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.880
instead of pulling the hose all at one

165
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.240
shot like in this picture

166
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.160
you would go ahead and put a kink in it

167
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.360
right kind of whip the hose put a kink

168
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.440
in it and let that kink

169
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.360
move down the whole length of the hose

170
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.600
and then you've managed to move

171
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.400
the hose over by whatever that kink size

172
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.680
was

173
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.720
so that's kind of the idea

174
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.600
this was first shown on these very

175
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.199
simple

176
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.000
experiments these bubble raft

177
00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:52.319
experiments so what i have here

178
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.840
are tiny little bubbles and they're

179
00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.800
floating on

180
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.759
water and what we're going to see and

181
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.759
they're packed

182
00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.880
real well and this looks like a

183
00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:05.599
hexagonal kind of packing that you'd see

184
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.560
on that one one one plane and face

185
00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:09.440
centered cubic again

186
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.560
what you're going to do is you're going

187
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.160
to start squeezing the bubbles together

188
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.680
and if you do that then you're going to

189
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.440
want to displace them you don't want to

190
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.120
have deformation

191
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.720
so what we're looking to see is do we

192
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.360
see entire

193
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.599
rows of atoms just suddenly moving

194
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.960
across one another to a new position

195
00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:29.039
or do we see something that looks more

196
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.520
like a dislocation where we get

197
00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:32.400
a distortion locally somewhere and then

198
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.840
that distortion

199
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.560
moves along as it moves

200
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.960
part of the crystal until it's complete

201
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.639
so

202
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.960
again these are just bubbles that's a

203
00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:45.280
very nice experiment

204
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.160
what do we get there they are seeing

205
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.039
these

206
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.400
lines that come running zipping across

207
00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:52.479
there it goes

208
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.759
those are the dislocations as they zip

209
00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:57.039
across

210
00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:57.599
this structure we're displacing there it

211
00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:00.879
is

212
00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:02.319
we're just placing one row of bubbles

213
00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:04.479
relative to the other so

214
00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:05.680
actually this entire crystal over here

215
00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:06.479
if you want to think of it that way if

216
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.639
bubbles

217
00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:11.759
is displaced relative to the bubbles

218
00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:14.319
below that line there goes another one

219
00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:17.759
shooting across here okay so this is the

220
00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:17.759
idea of a dislocation

221
00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:24.639
a tem micrograph again and i showed this

222
00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:26.560
before to you we saw dislocation lines

223
00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:29.599
in this tm

224
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.199
type micrograph but now we've got a

225
00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:34.719
sample that's being

226
00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:36.399
deformed plastically in the dm

227
00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:38.800
and what you'll get to see now is the

228
00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:42.159
motion of real dislocations

229
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.880
so there they are all just zooming along

230
00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:46.480
this direction again as they move along

231
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.760
they're displacing

232
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:53.760
this crystal one atomic plane

233
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:57.200
at a time and so this

234
00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:01.360
bending that you see in a macro scale

235
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.360
is actually done by the displacement

236
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:08.080
of large number huge numbers of

237
00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:08.880
dislocations your textbook will talk

238
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.160
about

239
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:15.120
the uh the numbers of dislocations that

240
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.040
uh you'll have in a solid and we'll talk

241
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.240
about a little bit more in chapter to

242
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.160
come

243
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:24.160
but huge numbers dislocations that are

244
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.160
moving the material at an atomic scale

245
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.920
and that results in the overall

246
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.560
deformation you see at a macro scale

247
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.600
so you can start imagining that if i

248
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.360
make it somehow

249
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.880
difficult for these dislocations to move

250
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.040
then i'm going to end up making it more

251
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.160
difficult for plastic deformation to

252
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.600
happen

253
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:51.839
and that indeed is what strengthening

254
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.839
is all about so that would be chapter 7.

255
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.080
all right structure wise just want to

256
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.600
make sure that you've got these two

257
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.200
types

258
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.040
kind of in your head there's the edge

259
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.440
dislocation this is the one that

260
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.920
sort of talked about before where it

261
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:09.200
looks like there's an extra plane

262
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:12.640
of atoms here in the structure but again

263
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:15.200
if you look out here things look good

264
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.079
square look down here they're looking

265
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.079
square

266
00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:19.360
it's right when i'm in here that i see

267
00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:22.079
that there's a distortion

268
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.000
and there's a little distortion up here

269
00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:26.079
so this is really where the dislocation

270
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.279
is this is the line that's coming in and

271
00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:28.800
out of the board

272
00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:30.839
so this is referred to as an edge

273
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.240
dislocation when you see this kind of

274
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:34.560
geometry

275
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.920
and then as you strain the material this

276
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.920
dislocation will move

277
00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:45.920
in this direction and it moves by

278
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.920
one atomic jump or what's called the

279
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.839
burgers vector it just describes the

280
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.680
magnitude

281
00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:53.760
each time the dislocation moves of

282
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.000
displacement

283
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.800
the edge dislocation is characterized by

284
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.839
the fact that the burgers vector

285
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.079
points perpendicular right

286
00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:07.200
to the edge dislocation which again is

287
00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:07.200
coming in and out of the board

288
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.279
so that's our edge dislocation

289
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.120
eventually when it gets over to the side

290
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.079
this will break and i'll end up with

291
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.680
this sticking out the other type of

292
00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:22.800
dislocation we can have which

293
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.920
is called a screw dislocation

294
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.120
and in this dislocation the displacement

295
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.040
of the solid

296
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.800
shown here the burgers vector so the

297
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.720
solid is going to the top half of the

298
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.760
solid is getting displaced that way

299
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:38.240
relative to this bottom half but the

300
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.800
dislocation line itself

301
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.600
is here running along the inside of this

302
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.680
solid

303
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:49.519
so my displacement here is now parallel

304
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.880
to my dislocation line

305
00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:53.040
that's different again than the edge

306
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.720
which is perpendicular it's really not

307
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.120
that important i'm not going to be

308
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.839
quizzing you on that that bit of this

309
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.040
but there's an

310
00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:01.200
edge and then there's a screw

311
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.200
dislocation and the one

312
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.959
the way to see this screw dislocation is

313
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.160
if you were to start off at some point

314
00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:08.320
here

315
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.600
well first let me just start off let's

316
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.000
say over here

317
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.200
if i was to start off here and i count

318
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.240
across

319
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.880
maybe four or five units one would i do

320
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.160
one two

321
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:23.519
three four one two three four one two

322
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:26.000
three four and then back up again i end

323
00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:28.560
up right where i started from

324
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.120
if i have a dislocation in my solid when

325
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.800
i do this

326
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.240
i'm going to be displaced from my

327
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.079
original location

328
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.000
this works for the edge dislocation as

329
00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:37.600
well as the screw

330
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.040
so let's go ahead and do that let's say

331
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.480
i start here and i go

332
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.560
let me just do by the so i'm gonna go

333
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.680
down two let's go one two

334
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.880
three four one two three

335
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:51.920
four one two three

336
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.800
four and then i gotta come back down two

337
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.680
so that

338
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.200
this is that displacement total of four

339
00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.240
okay so i formed my loop

340
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:03.120
but notice now that i'm one level

341
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.959
inside the material okay i've been

342
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.279
having displacement here

343
00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:09.120
that represents the burgers vector so if

344
00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:11.600
i do that again

345
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.120
then i'll just keep coming in and

346
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.200
spiraling

347
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:20.079
through the material so that's my my

348
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:22.079
screw dislocation

349
00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:24.800
all right so that's the end of the

350
00:13:22.079 --> 00:13:27.600
dislocation discussions like i said

351
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:32.480
we'll get into the importance of them

352
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.480
much more when we get to chapter seven
