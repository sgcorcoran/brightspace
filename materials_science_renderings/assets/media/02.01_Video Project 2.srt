1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,282
All right, for homework you will

2
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:06,853
be looking at the attractive and

3
00:00:06,853 --> 00:00:09,425
repulsive energies between two ions. This

4
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:11,997
is this example we have potassium

5
00:00:11,997 --> 00:00:14,568
and chloride. I don't remember I

6
00:00:14,568 --> 00:00:17,140
thought my head with your homework

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,712
was but they will give you

8
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,689
the. Attractive equation, the repulsive

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,816
equation. And remember, again, what we

10
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:26,653
need is just the net. So we're just

11
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:29,489
simply going to plot, simply going to add

12
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,326
these two. We're going to do this in

13
00:00:32,326 --> 00:00:35,162
a plot, so I'll show you what it

14
00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:38,113
looks like in Excel. Um,

15
00:00:38,113 --> 00:00:40,937
and then I'll post maybe a video helping

16
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:43,408
you actually work through Excel if you're

17
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:46,232
having trouble. But in Excel, we can go

18
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:48,703
ahead and make a column for the

19
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:51,174
attractive for repulsive and then add the

20
00:00:51,174 --> 00:00:53,998
two and then plot all of those versus

21
00:00:53,998 --> 00:00:56,469
the radius R and we'll generate this

22
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,294
curve that we just. Call and then from

23
00:00:59,294 --> 00:01:01,981
there we can read off the bond energy

24
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:03,661
and the equilibriums atom spacing.

25
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:09,504
OK, so again, this is going to remind you

26
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:12,085
of the equation. This is the data that

27
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:14,988
was given and I have all of that written

28
00:01:14,988 --> 00:01:16,601
over here from my constants.

29
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:21,622
In this case, I actually went through and

30
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:23,828
did the derivative of the equation and

31
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:26,349
found the equations for E0 and R0. So

32
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,555
that's what these were for. You don't

33
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,761
have to do that, these are calculated.

34
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:35,252
And So what I need to do is

35
00:01:35,252 --> 00:01:37,650
just simply plot this equation. So what

36
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,391
I'm going to do is make a column

37
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:43,131
of R values and the units are in

38
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:45,530
nanometers. So I'll go ahead and redo

39
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,270
that. And then I'll make a column for

40
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,668
the attractive energy piece and a column

41
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:52,381
for the repulsive energy piece.

42
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:56,136
And then I'll go ahead and add those two

43
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:58,860
for the net energy. And then all I need

44
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,281
to do is select these columns and tell

45
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:03,703
Excel to go ahead and scatter plot it.

46
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:06,124
And I'll get something like this here on

47
00:02:06,124 --> 00:02:08,849
the right. I know when you first go ahead

48
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:10,967
and do this in Excel, which you'll

49
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:13,086
probably find is that you don't see

50
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:15,119
actually anything. Except for maybe a

51
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:17,834
flat line, and then it looks like your

52
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:20,548
curve kind of does that. So if you

53
00:02:20,548 --> 00:02:23,263
double check on the limits of the axis

54
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:25,299
here, you'll probably find that they're

55
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:28,013
very, very high so that you can't see

56
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:30,728
as well, which is only on the order

57
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:33,443
of in this case, say almost .5 I

58
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:36,182
mean. Almost -5 EV's and that's because

59
00:02:36,182 --> 00:02:38,172
it very close spacings. The repulsive

60
00:02:38,172 --> 00:02:41,157
part is very very large so you notice the

61
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:44,142
size of these numbers. So what you can do

62
00:02:44,142 --> 00:02:47,127
is either skip some of those when you go

63
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:49,780
ahead and do your plotting or easier just

64
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,765
go ahead and double click on your Y axis

65
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:55,389
and change the scale. Is something much

66
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:57,412
more reasonable and you'll get yourcurve.
