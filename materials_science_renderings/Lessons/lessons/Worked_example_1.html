      <h2>Atomic Packing Factor (APF)</h2>

      <aside>
        <h4>Terminology: APF</h4>
        <p>
          The atomic packing factor (APF) is a measure of the packing efficiency
          of a given crystal structure. It is defined as the total volume of
          atoms in the unit cell divided by the overall volume of the unit cell.

      <h5>Number of atoms in the BCC unit cell:</h5>
      \[8 \text{ corners} \times \frac{1}{8}
      \left(\frac{\text{atom}}{\text{corner}}\right) + 1 \text{
      body&nbsp;center&nbsp;atom} = 2 \frac{\text{atoms}}{
      \text{unit&nbsp;cell}}\]

      <h5>Total volume of atoms in the unit cell:</h5>
      \[ 2\text{ atoms}\times \left(\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3\right) = \frac{8}{3}\pi
      R^3\] where \(R\) is the radius of the atoms and \(\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3\)
      is the volume of a sphere.

      </aside>

      For the BCC structure, atoms touch along the body diagonal as shown in
      figure (a) to the right. Six of the corner atoms have been removed from
      the BCC unit cell in this figure to make it easier to see the touching
      atoms. The triangle shown in bold has been redrawn in the second figure.
      The height of the triangle is equal to the unit cell edge length, \(a\),
      and the bottom leg is a face diagonal and therefore equal to \( a\sqrt{2}
      \). The diagonal of the cube is then given by the Pythagorean theorem as
      \[\text{Body diagonal} =\sqrt{(a\sqrt{2})^2 + (a)^2} = a\ \sqrt{3} \]

      <h5>Finding the edge length, \(\boldsymbol{a}\):</h5>
      From the figure (b) above, we can also see that the body diagonal is equal
      to \(4 R\). This can be observed by counting the number of line segments
      of length \(R\) shown along the hypotenuse of the figure. The important
      condition here is that the atoms are touching along this direction.
      Therefore we have, \[ 4 R = a\ \sqrt{3}\quad \text{ or }\quad
      a=\frac{4R}{\sqrt{3}}\]

      <h5>Finally:</h5>
      From the definition of the atomic packing factor, \[ APF =
      \frac{\text{total&nbsp;volume&nbsp;of&nbsp;atoms&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;unit&nbsp;cell}}{\text{unit&nbsp;cell&nbsp;volume}}
      = \frac{\frac{8}{3}\pi R^3}{a^3}\] \[=\frac{\frac{8}{3} \pi\
      R^3}{(\frac{4\ R}{\sqrt{3}})^3} = \frac{\pi\ \sqrt{3}}{8} \approx 0.68\]
      Therefore, 68% of the BCC unit cell is composed of atoms and the remaining
      32% is empty space.
