      <h1>Worked Example: size of the FCC tetrahedral site</h1>
      <p>
        Find the size of the largest interstital atom that will just fit into
        the tetrahedral site for the face-centered cubic structure.

        <h2>Objectives:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Identify the tetrahedral interstitial site in the FCC crystal
            structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Calculate the distance between the the center of the interstitial
            site to that of the nearest neighbor site.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the calculated distance and the appropriate edge length for the
            FCC structure, to determine the size of the interstitial site
            relative to the host atom radius.

          The small space located at the center of 4 neighboring atoms resulting
          in the formation of a tetrahedron as shown by the highlighted atoms.
          For the FCC structure, there are 8 such sites with each site located
          behind one of the corner atoms.

          Space filling model of the FCC structure with a small interstitial
          atom shown in red at position
          \((\frac{3}{4},\frac{3}{4},\frac{3}{4})\). The interstial atom sits in
          the center of a tetrahedron formed by its 4 neighbors (shaded grey).

      <h5>Location of tetrahedral sites in FCC structure:</h5>

      Using fractional coordinates, the tetrahedral site is located \((\pm 0.25,
      \pm0.25, \pm0.25)\) away from a corner atom. For example, if we are
      considering the corner atom at \((0,0,0)\), the tetrahedral site is
      located at \[(0,0,0)+(0.25,0.25,0.25)=(0.25,0.25,0.25)\] If we are
      considering the corner atom at \((1,0,0)\), however, the tetrahedral site
      is located at \[ (1,0,0)+(-0.25,0.25,0.25) = (0.75,0.25,0.25)\]
      <hr />
      <h5>Consider the interstitial atom and its corner neighbor:</h5>
      If we take the origin to be located at the bottom-back-left corner, then
      the corner atom shown shaded grey would have a position of (1,1,1) or in
      absolute coordinates \(a (1,1,1)\) and the tetrahedral site (small red
      atom) would be located at (0.75, 0.75, 0.75) or again in absolute units as
      \(a(0.75,0.75,0.75)\). These two atoms touch when the tetrahedral site is
      completely filled.
      <p>
        The line connecting the corner and the tetrahedral center is equal to
        \(r+R\) as shown in the figure.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <div style="width: max-content">
          <img
            width="250px"
            src="../assets/img/tetrahedral_corner_labeled.png"
          />
        </div>
        <figcaption>
          The corner atom \(a (1,1,1)\) with radius, \(R\), and the interstitial
          atom \(a(0.75,0.75,0.75)\) with radius, \(r\), are separated by the
          distance \(r+R\).
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      The length of this line can also be calculated by using the distance
      formula, \(d=\sqrt{(p_x-q_x)^2+(p_y-q_y)^2+(p_z-q_z)^2}\) where \(p\) and
      \(q\) are any two points or in our case where we know so far that
      \(d=r+R\): \[r+R=\sqrt{(1a-0.75a)^2+(1a-0.75a)^2+(1a-0.75a)^2}\] which
      simplifies to \(a\ \sqrt{\frac{3}{16}}\) or \(0.25\ a \ \sqrt{3}\).
      Therefore, we have \[r+R=0.25\ a \ \sqrt{3}\] Recall that for the
      <u>FCC</u>
      structure, \(a=\frac{4R}{\sqrt{2}}\). Substituting we have,
      \[r+R=0.25\&nbsp;\frac{4R}{\sqrt{2}}&nbsp;\ \sqrt{3}\] Solving for
      \(r\),&nbsp;\[r=(0.25\&nbsp;\frac{4R}{\sqrt{2}}&nbsp;\ \sqrt{3})-R \approx
      0.225 R\]
