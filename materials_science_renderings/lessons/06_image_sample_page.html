            <h1>Image Samples</h1>
            <p>This page includes samples of images.</p>
            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            <p>Images can be added to any of your pages to create visual interest and help break up text-heavy
                courses. This section illustrates the different ways images can be used. </p>
            <p>Follow the directions below to insert new images on other pages.</p>

            <h4>Replace Image</h4>
            <p>This template comes with some image placeholders. To replace the image:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Select the image and delete it (<strong>Note</strong>: Do not move your cursor)</li>
                <li>Click the <strong>Insert Image</strong> icon</li>
                <li>Select the source of your image</li>
                <li>Click the <strong>Choose Destination</strong> button to save it to the folder you want</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Recommendation for banner image size: at least 1200 pixels wide and 400 pixels high.</p>
            <h3>Insert New Image</h3>
            <p>Inserting your own image is simple. Once in the Edit HTML mode, you can use <strong>Insert
                    Image</strong> to add an image. If the image is not the right size, you can edit it using the
                inline image editor.</p>
            <h4>Image Alignment</h4>
            <p>The Brightspace Editor provides <strong>Align Left</strong>, <strong>Align Right</strong> and
                <strong>Align Full</strong> functions to place an image in particular location.
            </p>
            <p>For example, if you want your image to appear on the left with the text next to it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Insert your image on the empty line before the paragraph</li>
                <li>Crop the image or set its dimension to your desired size</li>
                <li>Apply <strong>Align Left</strong> on the selected image</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Copying Images</h2>
            <p>To copy any of the following images, please select everything between "start copy" and "end copy" for the
               specific image, then copy and paste into the Brightspace Editor.</p>
            <p><strong>To copy images onto a different page please make sure the page is in 'Edit' mode.</strong></p>
            <h3>Image Align Left</h3>

            <p>Hockey is a popular ice sport that is enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels around the
                world. The game is played with two teams, each consisting of six players - one goaltender and five
                skaters. The objective of the game is to shoot a small, rubber disc called a puck into the opposing
                team's net, while preventing the other team from doing the same to your own. Hockey is known for its
                fast-paced action, physicality, and strategic gameplay.</p>
            <p>Hockey has a rich history and culture that spans over a century. The sport originated in Canada in
                the late 19th century and quickly spread to other parts of the world. Today, hockey is played at
                both amateur and professional levels, with leagues and tournaments taking place throughout the year.
                Some of the most prestigious competitions include the National Hockey League (NHL) in North America
                and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) World Championships, which feature the best
                players from around the globe. Hockey has also become a beloved pastime for many fans, who follow
                their favorite teams and players with passion and enthusiasm.</p>
