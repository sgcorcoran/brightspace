      <h2>Metal Processing Techniques</h2>

      <!-- Casting -->
      <h3>Casting</h3>
      <p>Casting is the process of pouring molten metal into a mold, allowing it to solidify into a specific shape. This
        technique is used for producing large, complex components and can be performed using various methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sand Casting:</strong> Ideal for large, complex parts. The mold is made of sand and destroyed after
          each use.</li>
        <li><strong>Die Casting:</strong> Involves high-pressure injection of molten metal into a steel mold, suitable
          for high-volume production.</li>
        <li><strong>Investment Casting:</strong> Uses a wax pattern coated in ceramic. After the wax is melted away,
          metal is poured into the cavity.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Casting:</strong> Produces long sections of metal, such as rods and sheets, with
          consistent quality.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Forging -->
      <h3>Forging</h3>
      <p>Forging shapes metal through compressive forces, often at high temperatures. It improves the mechanical
        properties of the metal by refining the grain structure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Open-Die Forging:</strong> The metal is compressed between flat dies, allowing for free flow and
          large deformations.</li>
        <li><strong>Closed-Die Forging:</strong> The metal is confined within shaped dies, resulting in a precise final
          shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold vs. Hot Forging:</strong> Cold forging increases strength through strain hardening, while hot
          forging allows easier deformation.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Rolling -->
      <h3>Rolling</h3>
      <p>Rolling reduces the thickness of metal sheets by passing them through rotating rolls. It can be performed at
        different temperatures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hot Rolling:</strong> Performed above the recrystallization temperature, resulting in larger grain
          sizes and a rough surface finish.</li>
        <li><strong>Cold Rolling:</strong> Performed below the recrystallization temperature, increasing strength and
          providing a smoother finish.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Extrusion -->
      <h3>Extrusion</h3>
      <p>Extrusion involves forcing a metal billet through a die to create a long product with a specific
        cross-sectional shape. It can be performed hot or cold, depending on the material and desired properties.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct Extrusion:</strong> The billet is pushed through the die by a ram.</li>
        <li><strong>Indirect Extrusion:</strong> The die moves towards the stationary billet, reducing the required
          force.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Machining -->
      <h3>Machining</h3>
      <p>Machining removes material from a workpiece to achieve a precise shape. Common techniques include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Turning:</strong> The workpiece rotates while a cutting tool removes material.</li>
        <li><strong>Milling:</strong> A rotating cutting tool moves across the surface, shaping the material.</li>
        <li><strong>Drilling:</strong> Creates cylindrical holes in the workpiece.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Heat Treatment -->
      <h3>Heat Treatment</h3>
      <p>Heat treatment involves heating and cooling a metal to alter its microstructure and properties. Common
        processes include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annealing:</strong> Softens the metal and relieves internal stresses.</li>
        <li><strong>Quenching:</strong> Rapid cooling increases hardness but can introduce brittleness.</li>
        <li><strong>Tempering:</strong> Reheating quenched metal to reduce brittleness while maintaining hardness.</li>
        <li><strong>Case Hardening:</strong> Increases surface hardness while keeping the core tough.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Additive Manufacturing -->
      <!-- Additive Manufacturing: Friction Stir Deposition -->
      <h3>Additive Manufacturing: Friction Stir Deposition</h3>
      <p>Friction Stir Deposition (FSD) is a solid-state additive manufacturing process that combines the principles of
        friction stir welding with material deposition. It is an innovative technique used for additive manufacturing,
        repair, and coating applications, particularly with metals.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solid-State Process:</strong> Unlike traditional additive manufacturing, FSD does not melt the
          material. Instead, a rotating tool generates heat through friction, softening the metal and allowing it to be
          deposited layer by layer.</li>
        <li><strong>High Bond Strength:</strong> The process produces strong metallurgical bonds due to mechanical
          stirring and pressure, resulting in excellent adhesion and minimal porosity.</li>
        <li><strong>Material Versatility:</strong> FSD can be used with a wide range of metals, including aluminum,
          copper, and titanium alloys, as well as dissimilar metal combinations.</li>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Commonly used for surface coatings, part repair, and manufacturing of complex
          geometries, especially in the aerospace and automotive industries.</li>
      </ul>
