                        <p>
                            It is important to distinguish between the covalent bonds within a water molecule and the
                            secondary bonding (hydrogen bonds) between water molecules. Missing this distinction
                            can lead to misunderstandings. More than once, I have had students incorrectly recall from
                            high
                            school chemistry
                            that covalent bonds are weak and water is used as the example to support this. Let's take a
                            look
                            at the intra- and inter-
                            molecular bonds of water.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Covalent Bonds within Water Molecules:</strong> The two hydrogen atoms in a
                                water
                                molecule are bonded to the oxygen atom via strong covalent bonds. Each covalent bond has
                                an
                                energy of approximately <strong>460 kJ/mol</strong> (~4.8 eV/atom), making it
                                significantly
                                stronger than any secondary bond.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hydrogen Bonds between Water Molecules:</strong> Secondary bonding occurs when
                                the
                                partially positive hydrogen of one water molecule interacts with the partially negative
                                oxygen of another forming a hydrogen bond. This bond is weak with a bond energy of
                                approximately <strong>20
                                    kJ/mol</strong> (~0.2 eV/atom).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            But water has a low melting point so the bonds are weak? True, but the bonds that are weak
                            here
                            are the bonds
                            holding the water molecules to one another i.e the inter-molecular bonds (hydrogen bonding).
                            The
                            bonds within
                            the water molecule (intra-molecular) are covalent and do not break until excessively high
                            temperatures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To illustrate further:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boiling water (~100°C) breaks the <strong>hydrogen bonds</strong> between molecules,
                                allowing water to transition to a gas.</li>
                            <li>Breaking the <strong>covalent bonds</strong> within water molecules would require much
                                higher energy, as it involves splitting the molecule into individual hydrogen and oxygen
                                atoms.</li>
                        </ul>

                <!-- Primary and Secondary Bonds -->
                <h2>Primary and Secondary Bond Types</h2>
                <p>
                    Bonding can be categorized into primary (strong) and secondary (weak) interactions, each influencing
                    material properties differently.
                </p>

                <!-- Primary Bonds -->
                <h3>Primary Bonds</h3>
                <p>Primary bonds are strong, involving either electron transfer or electron sharing (localized as in a
                    ceramic or delocalized as in a metal).
                    There are 3 primary bond types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ionic Bonds:</strong> Formed when one atom transfers its electron(s) to another atom.
                        Once the transfer occurs, the atoms
                        are now charged and referred to as ions. For example, sodium (Na) with
                        one valence electron (column 1 on periodic table) gives up its electron to chlorine (Cl) which
                        initially has 7 valence electrons (column 17 on periodic table).
                        Now both the sodium ion and chloride ion have 8 valence electrons. This transfer gives both
                        atoms a noble gas configuration (8 valence electrons).</li>
                    <li><strong>Covalent Bonds:</strong> A localized bond formed when atoms share electrons with
                        electron orbital overlap. Covalent bonds have
                        a strong angular dependence. For example, in water
                        (H<sub>2</sub>O), oxygen shares electrons with two hydrogen atoms, allowing all three atoms to
                        mimic
                        noble gas configurations and the angular dependence results in a bond angle of 104.5 degrees.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Metallic Bonds:</strong> In metals, atoms share a "sea of electrons" as each metal gives
                        up its valence electron(s). This occurs
                        because the valence electrons in metals are loosely bound. This "sea of electrons" or
                        delocalized electrons are now free to move and are why
                        metals make good electrical and thermal conductors.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Secondary Bonds -->
                <h3>Secondary Bonds</h3>
                <p>Secondary bonds are much weaker than primary bonds, and are the result of electrostatic attraction
                    between partially charged atoms. There are two types: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hydrogen Bonds:</strong>A least 10 times weaker than metallic bonds, hydrogen bonds
                        result from electrostatic interactions
                        between molecules where hydrogen is bonded to a high electronegative atom (e.g. H<sub>2</sub>O).
                        The hydrogen bond is formed between molecules whereas within the
                        molecule the hydrogen is bound covalently. See the aside titled "Bonding in Water" for a more
                        detailed description.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Van der Waals Forces:</strong> Are very weak bonds formed by electrostatic interactions
                        between molecules that have fluctuating charge distribution (dipole).
                        These interactions are important in soft materials such as the interactions between chains of
                        polyethylene, interactions between noble gas molecules,
                        bonding between graphite sheets, and perhaps the adhesion of a Gecko's feet to surfaces. </li>

                    <li><strong>Note of Caution:</strong> the bonding between molecules such as methane, CH<sub>4</sub>
                        or between chains in
                        polymers such as polyethylene C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub> are Van der Waals and not hydrogen
                        bonding even though the molecules contain hydrogen. This is
                        because carbon is not a highly electronegative atom and does not result in a charge difference
                        as say oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine would create. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Quantitatively, primary bonds (100-3800 kJ/mol) are much stronger than secondary bonds (0.1 - 40 kJ/mol) as shown in the table above.  

                <!-- Electron Configuration and Bonding -->
                <h2>Electron Configuration and Bonding</h2>
                <p>
                    Electron configuration plays an important role in determining bond types by simply considering the outer electrons (valence electrons). 
                    Atoms will tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve 8 valence electrons resembling that of the nearest noble gas (column 18 on periodic table). 
                    Let's take a look at some examples. 
                    </p><p>The electron configuration notation, such as 1s² 2s² 2p⁶, represents the distribution of electrons in an atom's orbitals, organized by increasing energy levels. 
                    The notation breaks down into three parts: the principal quantum number (e.g., 1, 2, 3), which indicates the electron shell or energy level; the subshell type (e.g., s, p, d, f), 
                    which specifies the shape of the orbital; and the superscript, which denotes the number of electrons in that subshell. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Ionic Bond</strong>Consider the case of an ionic bond formed when atoms transfer electrons. For example, sodium (Na)
                    with one valence electron easily loses it to chlorine (Cl), which needs one electron to complete its
                    outer shell. This transfer gives both atoms a noble gas configuration.
                
                    <ul><strong>NaCl:</strong>
                        <br>Na has \([Ne] 3s^1\) which is one electron from Ne = \(1s^2\ 2s^2\ 2p^6\)
                        <br>Cl has \([Ne] 3s^2\ 3p^5\) which is one electron from Ar = \(1s^2\ 2s^2\ 2p^6\ 3s^2\ 3p^6\)
                        <br>so let's move the one electron from Na to the Cl: 
                        <br>Na<sup>+1</sup> ion = \(1s^2\ 2s^2\ 2p^6\)
                        <br>Cl<sup>-1</sup> ion = \(1s^2\ 2s^2\ 2p^6\ 3s^2\ 3p^6\)
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Covalent Bonds:</strong> Formed when atoms share electrons. For example, in water
                        (H<sub>2</sub>O), oxygen \([He] 2s^2 2p^4\) shares electrons with two hydrogen atoms \(1s^1\), allowing all three atoms to
                        mimic noble gas configurations, Ne and He respectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Metallic Bonds:</strong> In metals, atoms form a "sea of electrons" due to the delocalization of their valence electrons. Unlike in covalent or ionic bonding, metal atoms 
                        do not completely give up or share electrons to achieve an "octet." Instead, their outermost s and, in many cases, d orbitals contribute to a "sea" of free-moving electrons. 
                        These delocalized electrons are not bound to any specific atom and are free to move throughout the lattice. This mobility of electrons gives metals their high 
                        electrical and thermal conductivity, as well as their malleability and ductility. The positively charged atomic nuclei remain fixed in the lattice, held together by the electrostatic 
                        attraction to the shared "electron sea." </li>
                </ul>



                <h4>Metallic Bonding: FCC vs. BCC</h4>
                <p>
                    Metallic bonding involves delocalized electrons shared across a lattice. The bond strength depends
                    on
                    the electron density and orbital overlap. In FCC metals (e.g., copper, aluminum), bonding is
                    primarily
                    isotropic with moderate cohesive energies (e.g., 300 - 500 kJ/mol). In contrast, BCC metals like
                    tungsten
                    and molybdenum exhibit stronger directional bonding due to contributions from partially filled
                    <em>d</em>-orbitals, resulting in higher cohesive energies (e.g., 400 - 860 kJ/mol for W).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The higher cohesive energies in BCC metals explains their generally higher melting points compared to
                    FCC
                    metals, despite lower packing efficiency.

                <h3>White Tin vs. Gray Tin</h3>
                <p>
                    Tin exists in two allotropes (different structural forms), each with distinct bonding and properties:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>White Tin (\(\beta\)-Tin):</strong> Is the metallic structure stable at room temperature. Exhibits
                        metallic bonding with delocalized electrons, leading to a ductile, conductive metal with a cohesive energy 
                        of approximately 300 kJ/mol.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gray Tin (\(\alpha\) - Tin):</strong> Is the covalent structure stable below 13.2&deg;C. Forms a
                        diamond
                        cubic structure with directional covalent bonds, leading to brittle non conductive solid with but with the same
                         cohesive energy of approximately 300 kJ/mol.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The transition from white tin to gray tin, known as <em>tin pest</em>, involves significant volume
                    expansion and can cause structural failure in tin-based materials in cold environments.

                        <p>
                            Bond hybridization is the process by which atomic orbitals combine to form new hybrid
                            orbitals
                            that are better suited for bonding. An <strong>orbital</strong> is a region around an atom
                            where
                            there is a high probability of finding electrons. These hybrid orbitals determine the
                            geometry
                            and strength of chemical bonds.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, carbon atoms in diamond undergo <strong>sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridization</strong>,
                            where one s-orbital and three p-orbitals mix to form four equivalent tetrahedral bonds. This
                            configuration gives diamond its characteristic hardness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In contrast, in graphene or graphite, carbon atoms undergo
                            <strong>sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridization</strong>, mixing one s-orbital and two p-orbitals,
                            leaving
                            one p-orbital unhybridized. This results in a planar structure with delocalized electrons,
                            which
                            contribute to graphene's exceptional electrical conductivity.

                <h2>What is Electronegativity?</h2>
                <p>
                    Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract and hold onto electrons within a
                    chemical
                    bond. It is a fundamental concept that helps explain the nature of chemical bonding and the behavior
                    of
                    molecules.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Electronegativity:</strong> Atoms with high electronegativity (e.g. columns 16,17
                        on
                        periodic table), such as oxygen or
                        fluorine, have a strong tendency to attract electrons toward themselves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Electronegativity:</strong> Atoms with low electronegativity (e.g. columns 1,2 on
                        periodic table), like sodium or potassium,
                        are less able to attract electrons and often lose them in bonding.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The difference in electronegativity between two bonded atoms determines the type of bond formed:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ionic Bonds:</strong> Form when the electronegativity difference is large (>1.7),
                        causing
                        one atom
                        to completely transfer electrons to the other (e.g., NaCl).</li>
                    <li><strong>Covalent Bonds:</strong> Form when the electronegativity difference is small (&lt;0.5),
                        leading to
                        shared electrons between atoms (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Polar Covalent Bonds:</strong> Occur when the difference is moderate (0.5 - 1.7),
                        resulting
                        in uneven
                        electron sharing and partial charges (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Electronegativity is quantified on the Pauling scale, where fluorine is the most electronegative
                    element
                    with a value of 3.98, and cesium is one of the least electronegative with a value of 0.79.

                <p>
                    In general, electronegativity differences can be categorized as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low Electronegativity Difference (< 0.5):</strong> Indicates <strong>nonpolar covalent
                                    bonds</strong>, where electrons are shared nearly equally between the atoms.
                                <br><strong>Example:</strong> CH<sub>4</sub> (methane), with a difference of |2.55 -
                                2.20| =
                                0.35.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Moderate Electronegativity Difference (0.5–1.7):</strong> Indicates <strong>polar
                            covalent
                            bonds</strong>, where electrons are shared unequally, resulting in partial charges.
                        <br><strong>Example:</strong> H<sub>2</sub>O (water), with a difference of |3.44 - 2.20| = 1.24.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>High Electronegativity Difference (> 1.7):</strong> Indicates <strong>ionic
                            bonds</strong>,
                        where electrons are transferred from one atom to another, forming ions.
                        <br><strong>Example:</strong> NaCl, with a difference of |3.16 - 0.93| = 2.23.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Percent Ionic Character Example</h2>
                <p>
                    The percent ionic character of a bond (the remainder being covalent) can be estimated using the
                    electronegativity difference (ΔEN) and
                    the following formula:
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                    <strong>Percent Ionic Character</strong> =
                    <strong>[1 - exp(-0.25 (ΔEN)<sup>2</sup>)] × 100</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>NaCl:</strong>
                        <br>ΔEN = |3.16 - 0.93| = 2.23
                        <br>Percent Ionic Character = [1 - exp(-0.25 (2.23)<sup>2</sup>)] × 100
                        <br>= [1 - exp(-1.243)] × 100
                        <br>= [1 - 0.288] × 100
                        <br>= 71.2%
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>H-O Bond (Water):</strong>
                        <br>ΔEN = |3.44 - 2.20| = 1.24
                        <br>Percent Ionic Character = [1 - exp(-0.25 (1.24)<sup>2</sup>)] × 100
                        <br>= [1 - exp(-0.3841)] × 100
                        <br>= [1 - 0.681] × 100
                        <br>= 31.9%
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>C-H Bond (Methane):</strong>
                        <br>ΔEN = |2.55 - 2.20| = 0.35
                        <br>Percent Ionic Character = [1 - exp(-0.25 (0.35)<sup>2</sup>)] × 100
                        <br>= [1 - exp(-0.030625)] × 100
                        <br>= [1 - 0.9698] × 100
                        <br>= 3.0%
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These examples demonstrate the varying ionic character of different bonds:
                    NaCl has ionic bonding (~71% ionic, 29% covalent); The H-O bond in water is covalent (68%) but
                    significantly polar (~32% ionic); and
                    The C-H bond in methane is essentially completely covalent (97%) with only a 3.0% ionic character.
