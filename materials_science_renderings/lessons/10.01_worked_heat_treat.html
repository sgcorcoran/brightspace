<h4>Key Concept: Phase Transformation and Crystallinity</h4>
<p>Phase transformations in metals involve changes in the crystal structure due to temperature variations. The TTT diagram helps predict the phase fractions at different temperatures and cooling rates. For polymers, heat treatment can alter the degree of crystallinity, which affects the material's properties. Crystallinity is often analyzed using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), which measures the heat flow associated with phase transitions.</p>

<h3>Expanded Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Analyze the following heat treatment scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>A steel alloy (0.8% Carbon) is cooled rapidly from \( 800 \, ^\circ\text{C} \) to room temperature. Use the TTT diagram to estimate the fraction of martensite formed.</li>
<li>A sample of Polyethylene is heat-treated and analyzed using DSC. The melting enthalpy (\( \Delta H_m \)) is measured as \( 180 \, \text{J/g} \), and the theoretical enthalpy of fusion for 100% crystalline Polyethylene is \( 290 \, \text{J/g} \). Determine the degree of crystallinity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<h4>Step 1: Analyze Phase Transformation in Steel Using the TTT Diagram</h4>
<p>For a 0.8% Carbon steel cooled rapidly, the TTT diagram indicates complete martensite formation at room temperature. The fraction of martensite (\( f_m \)) is:</p>
\[
f_m = 1.0 \text{ (100% martensite)}
\]

<p>Given the rapid cooling rate, the austenite does not have sufficient time to transform into pearlite or bainite.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Calculate the Degree of Crystallinity for Polyethylene</h4>
<p>The degree of crystallinity (\( X_c \)) is given by:</p>
\[
X_c = \frac{\Delta H_m}{\Delta H_{m,100\%}} \times 100
\]
<p>Substitute the given values:</p>
\[
X_c = \frac{180 \, \text{J/g}}{290 \, \text{J/g}} \times 100 = 62.1\%
\]

<h4>Step 3: Interpretation of Results</h4>
<p>The steel alloy exhibits a complete martensitic transformation due to rapid cooling, resulting in a hard and brittle microstructure. The Polyethylene sample shows a moderate degree of crystallinity, affecting its mechanical properties, such as stiffness and toughness.</p>
