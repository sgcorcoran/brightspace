                    <p>Materials are everywhere, from natural materials such as wool, wood, or stone
                        to engineered materials like steel, acrylic, glass, or concrete. Natural materials
                        require little human modification to be put to use whereas engineered materials undergo
                        significant processing. <strong>This course will focus on understanding the structure, properties,
                        and processing of engineered materials.</strong></p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                The major classes of engineered materials are typically given as metals,
                ceramics, and polymers but from a practical point of view it may be better to
                expand this list to <strong>metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, elastomers, and
                    composites</strong>. In this course, we will use the expanded scheme.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Why do we need an expanded classification scheme beyond just metals, ceramics, and polymers?</strong>
                The expanded scheme is based on the similarities of materials with respect to their most
                basic properties and processing methods. Glasses for example could be included in the ceramics
                class but ceramics are mostly crystalline and processed by high temperature sintering whereas
                glasses are amorphous, transparent and processed while a viscous liquid.
            </p>

            <p>In the context of this course, we will not include semiconductors in our expanded classification scheme.
                While doing so would not be incorrect, it could lead to the inclusion of other specialized categories
                such as biomedical materials, nanomaterials, quantum materials, or biomaterials, making the
                classification system overly complex.</p>
            <p>Semiconductors themselves span a range of materials, including ceramic compounds like silicon carbide
                (SiC), gallium nitride (GaN), and titanium dioxide (TiO₂), as well as elemental semiconductors such as
                silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). These materials play a crucial role in electronic and optoelectronic
                applications but fall outside the primary focus of this course.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Consider the materials property chart shown below. This chart shows the Young's modulus of
                various materials vs the material density. <strong>Notice how nicely our expanded classification scheme
                is represented on this chart </strong> especially when it comes to separating the subclass of elastomers
                from the parent class polymers.
