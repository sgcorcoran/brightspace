            <h2>What is Materials Science and Engineering (MSE)?</h2>
            <p>
                Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) is an engineering discipline that blends principles of
                physics, chemistry, and engineering. By investigating and manipulating the structures of
                materials, MSE enables groundbreaking innovations in various industries, from electronics and healthcare
                to
                aerospace and renewable energy. At its core, MSE revolves around the principle that <strong>structure
                    affects
                    properties</strong> and <strong>processing controls structure in understandable and predictable
                    ways.</strong> The materials scientist's interest might focus
                on bringing more understanding to this principle while the materials engineer's interest might focus
                more on using current understanding to
                design materials for optimal performance in a given design scenario. I personally prefer not to make a
                strong distinction between the science and
                engineering side of the discipline as all materials problems require a blend of approaches.

            <h2>The Impact of MSE</h2>
            <p>
                Consider the remarkable materials around you: the durable alloys in aerospace components, the efficient
                semiconductors powering your devices, and the biocompatible polymers in medical implants. MSE empowers
                society
                to design and produce such advanced materials, driving technological progress and addressing critical
                challenges like sustainability, energy efficiency, and healthcare solutions.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Study MSE?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relevance Across Disciplines:</strong> MSE serves as a foundation for innovation in nearly
                    every engineering field, offering tools and insights that enhance understanding and development in
                    mechanical, electrical, civil, and biomedical engineering.</li>
                <li><strong>Diverse Applications:</strong> From creating stronger, lighter materials for vehicles to
                    optimizing energy storage solutions for a sustainable future, MSE's applications are limitless.</li>
                <li><strong>Empowering Problem-Solving:</strong> With its interdisciplinary nature, MSE equips engineers
                    with the knowledge to tackle some of the world’s most pressing problems, like reducing carbon
                    emissions or improving medical technologies.</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Materials Classification</h2>
            <p>
                MSE encompasses a broad range of materials, including those that require minimal processing which we
                will refer to as <strong>natural materials</strong> and those
                that require significant processing which we will refer to as <strong>engineered materials</strong>.
                Natural materials include such things as wood, stone, cork, cotton, silk, leather, and clay.
                Engineered materials include metals and alloys, ceramics and glasses, polymers and elastomers,
                composites, and semiconductors. This course will focus on engineered materials.
            </p>
            <p>The major classes of engineered materials are typically given as metals,
                ceramics, polymers, and composites. This classification is based on structural and/or mechanical properties. 
                However, as shown below in the Materials Property Chart an expanded classification scheme may be more practical such as: 
                <strong>metals and alloys, ceramics, glasses, polymers, elastomers, and composites</strong>. Notice how these "families" of materials
                are fairly distinct when considering the Young's modulus vs Density.

            <h3>Future Directions</h3>
            <p>
                As technology progresses, MSE will continue to expand its boundaries. Collaboration between disciplines
                such as artificial intelligence, biology, and environmental science will drive the next wave of material
                innovations, ensuring a sustainable and prosperous future for generations to come.

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                As you continue through this course, consider how the principles and applications discussed can
                enhance your understanding of materials in your current discipline. Engage with interactive materials,
                explore real-world case studies, and consider how MSE aligns with your career aspirations. Chances are that 
                a materials engineer will be on your team after you graduate. In fact, look through the web pages of the faculty 
                in your discipline. I bet at least one of them has a degree or performs research in materials science and engineering.
