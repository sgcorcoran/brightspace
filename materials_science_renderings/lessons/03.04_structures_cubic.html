      <h2>The Three Bravais Lattices of the Cubic Crystal System</h2>

      <p>The cubic crystal system has three Bravais lattices: <strong>simle cubic (sc), body-centered cubic
          (bcc)</strong> and<strong> face-centered
          cubic (fcc)</strong> as shown above. To create a specific <strong>crystal structure</strong>, we need to
        associate a basis of atoms
        with each lattice point. The least complicated crystal structure (typical of metals) would be to place a single
        atom
        type at each point. For example, iron is a bcc lattice with one iron atom located at each lattice point as
        represented in the figure below.

            <h4>Terminology: Unit Cell</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="courseware-card-body">
            <p>The unit cell is the smallest unit that when repeated side-by-side in 3 dimensions forms the overall
              crystalline structure. The least complicated unit cell is composed of a Bravais lattice with only one atom
              located at each
              lattice point. The cut-sphere model is the best representation of a unit cell since it shows only the
              the part of the atoms within the cell, i.e the corners contain 1/8 of an atom while the faces contain 1/2
              of an atom.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        By associating 1 atom with each
        point of the sc, bcc, and fcc lattices, we can generate 3 distinct cubic crystal structures as shown above.
        When viewing these cells, see if you can <strong>identify the directions in
          which the atoms touch</strong> e.g. along edges, along body diagonals, or along face diagonals.
        Also notice that the total number of atoms in each unit cell (and the volume of each cell)
        increases. By counting corners as 1/8 of an atom, faces as 1/2 of an atom, and the body center as 1 atom, we
        find
        that the simple cubic cell contains 1 full atom; the body-centered structure contains 2 atoms; and the
        face-centered structure contains 4 atoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The radius of the atoms used in these illustrations were kept constant to accurately reflect the relative sizes
        of each unit cell. However, notice that the size of the fcc unit cell
        is not 4 times the size of the sc cell (more about this later) even though it contains 4 times the number
        of atoms. </p>

      <p></p>


      <p></p>
      <h2>Compare SC and BCC unit cells</h2>
      <p>The sc cell contains 1 atom while the bcc cell contains 2 atoms but the cell volume does not double in size.
        In fact, it is only 1.54 times larger in volume. This implies that the packing efficiency (and therefore
        density) must be greater for the bcc lattice as compared to the SC
        lattice. We can quantify this by calculating the percent volume of each unit cell taken up by atoms. The
        atoms in the simple cubic lattice take up 50% of the volume while in the bcc lattice atoms take up 68% of the
        volume.
        This packing efficiency is usually expressed in fractional form and referred to as the atomic packing factor
        (APF). Thus, we would say that the
          <a
          href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=6671&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=5D226BA0-B758-434B-83E5-48F8BA488EB5-290"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration-line: underline;"> body-centered cubic structure has an APF of 0.68</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Repeating Unit Cell</h2>
      <p>The interactive below allows you to bring together several unit cells for the bcc structure. The red atom is
        just to aid the eye. Notice how it takes 4 unit cells to create 1/2 of the red atom i.e. the whole red atom is
        shared
        with a total of 8 unit cells.

      <p>Many structures are often difficult to visualize when drawn in 2D. The interactive
        below will allow you to rotate, zoom in and out, and change the atom size to aid in
        visualizing the fcc structure. Try increasing the size of the atoms until they just touch.
        At this size, you can look for the directions that the atoms touch. At smaller atom sizes, you
        can "see" into the structure and notice for example that the body center is empty. If you use the
        maximum radius size, you can zoom all they way into the structure and explore the size
        of the space at the body center.
