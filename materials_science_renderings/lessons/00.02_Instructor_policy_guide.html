        <p>GENERAL NOTES:</p>
        <p>Honor system upheld. Unless otherwise indicated, homework, quizzes, projects / assignments, tests, and the final exam are to be completed on an individual basis. While discussing homework (working together) and getting help (seeking understanding not answers) for homework outside of class is encouraged, copying solutions from any source is a violation, as is the sharing or re-use of any full or partial solutions to problems. It is your responsibility to seek clarification if you are unsure about the applicability of the honor code to any assignment. Suspected violations of the Honor Code will be processed, and dealt with as recommended by the Honor Court.</p>
        <p>Due to the volume of work and pace of this class, late homework will only be accepted under penalty of 25% grade reduction per day late.</p>
        <p>Missed Tests-- Make-ups for exams will be given under reasonable (not “social”) circumstances when arrangements are made in advance, or with documentation from the Dean of Students Office or for medical reasons documented through Health Services. Contact me within 24 hours of the original exam time to arrange a make-up exam.</p>
        <p>If you require any auxiliary aids, services, or other accommodations for this class, please come and see me as soon as you have the required documentation.</p>
