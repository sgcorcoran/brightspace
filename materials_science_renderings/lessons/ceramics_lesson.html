      <h3>Cation/Anion Ratio and Coordination Number</h3>
      <p>The coordination number (CN) of a ceramic depends on the ratio of the cation radius to the anion radius:</p>

          <h4>Coordination Number (CN)</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="courseware-card-body">
          <p>The term <em>Coordination Number (CN)</em> refers to the number of nearest neighbor ions of opposite charge
            surrounding a given ion in a ceramic structure. The CN is determined by the cation/anion radius ratio in accordance with the table given above.</p>
          <p>For the ceramic, \(\text{ZnS}\) we have \( r_{Zn^{2+}} = 0.074 \, nm \) and \( r_{S^{2-}} = 0.184 \, nm \).</p>
          <p>The ratio of ionic radii is therefore: \( \frac{0.074}{0.184} = 0.402 \) which from the table above indicates a CN = 4 which is the tetrahedral structure. </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      

      <h3>Predicting the Structure of \(\text{ZnS}\)</h3>
      <p>To predict the structure of ZnS, we first need to determine the coordination number, CN, given by the ratio of cation to anion.  This calculation is shown in the aside.  We see that the expected CN is 4 which gives a tetrahedral structure.
        The tetrahedral site is located in the FCC crystal structure behind each corner atom (or ion) therefore there are 8 possible tetrahedral sites as shown in figure (a) below. If all 8 sites were filled with \(Zn^{2+}\), we would have 8 zinc ions but only 4 sulfur ions (8 corners * 1/8 + 6 faces * 1/2) per unit cell. 
      This is a 2:1 ratio of ions but ZnS as written has a 1:1 ratio so we need only fill 4 of the 8 tetrahedral sites.  This leaves us with several choices, two of which are shown (b) and (c) below.  Since like charges repel, we want to maximize the distance between all Zn ions.  This is 
    given in the last structure (C).    </p>

        <figcaption>Possible structures for ZnS that satisfy a CN = 4.  <strong>(a)</strong> All 8 tetrahedral sites are filled. This gives a 2:1 ratio of ions (8 zinc, 4 sulur) but the formula ZnS is in the ratio 1:1 so this is not the correct structure.  
          <strong>(b)</strong> 4 of the 8 sites are filled giving the correct 1:1 ratio but we can do a better job at keeping the zinc ions away from each other. <strong>(c) This is the correct structure. 
          We now have the correct 1:1 ratio and we have maximized the distance bewteen the zinc ions.</strong></figcaption>

      <h3>Calculating the Density, \(\rho\), of Ceramics</h3>
      <p>Givens: \( n_i \) is the number of ions of type \(i\) in the unit cell, \( A_i \) is the atomic mass, \(\frac{g}{mole}\) of each ion type, and \( N_A \) is Avogadro's
        number, \(\frac{ions}{mole}\). The quantity \(\frac{A_i}{N_A}\) is therefore the <strong>grams per ion</strong> of type \( i \).  If we multiply this quantify by the number of ions in the unit cell according to their types and sum, we will get the total number of grams contained in the unit cell.
        \[\sum_i{\frac{A_i\cdot n_i}{N_A}}=\frac{\text{total grams}}{\text{unit cell}}\]
        The density is just the number of grams contained within a given volume or in our case the number of grams per unit cell volume, \(a^3\). 
        \[\rho=\sum_i{\frac{A_i\cdot n_i}{N_A \cdot V_c}}=\sum_i{\frac{A_i\cdot n_i}{N_A \cdot a^3}}\]  where \(a\) is the cubic unit cell edge length.

      <h3>Stress-Strain Behavior of Ceramics</h3>
      <p>Ceramics are brittle and exhibit very low tensile strength. They have high compressive strength but fracture at
        low strains.</p>

      <h2>Day 3: Phase Diagrams and Porosity Effects</h2>
      <h3>Phase Diagrams</h3>
      <p>Phase diagrams are used to understand the stability and phase transformations of ceramic systems. The
        MgO-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> phase diagram is a common example.</p>

      <h3>Effect of Porosity on Mechanical Properties</h3>
      <p>Porosity reduces the strength and stiffness of ceramics. The modulus of a porous ceramic can be estimated
        using:</p>
      <p>\( E_{ ext{porous}} = E_0 (1 - 1.9P + 0.9P^2) \)</p>
      <div class="courseware-card aside-card">
        <h4>Example Calculation</h4>
        <p>For a ceramic with \( E_0 = 200 \, GPa \) and \( P = 0.1 \), calculate the effective modulus.</p>
