      <h2>Fractional vs Point Coordinates</h2>

          <p>Triclinic Bravais lattice. The circled atom is located at (a,b,c) along the \(a, b, \) and \(c\)
            directions.

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> The triclinic system is the most general lattice we can have. Notice that none of the angles
        equal 90 degrees nor do they equal each other; all edge lengths, \(a, b, c\) are unequal as well.
        If we wanted to specify the <strong>point coordinate</strong> for the circled atom in the figure we would have
        to find the sum of the edge vectors
        \(\stackrel{\rightharpoonup}{a}+\stackrel{\rightharpoonup}{b}+\stackrel{\rightharpoonup}{c}\).
        We can't simply write
        (a,b,c) because the edges don't form a cartesian system. This is where <strong>fractional coordinates</strong>
        are
        extremely handy. Most of the time we just want to know where a given atom is within the unit cell, that is, the
        unit cell is our reference.
        Fractional coordinates are coordinates given relative to the unit cell. To specify the circled atom,
        we would just write (1,1,1). This means we move a full unit cell distance i.e. 1, along each of the
        unit cell edge directions. This atom is in the opposite corner to the origin. </p>

      <h2>Example: Using fractional coordinates for the tetrahedral site in fcc</h2>
      <p>In the cubic system, where the edges form a cartesian system (all angles are 90 degrees), point coordinates and
        fractional coordinates
        are easy to switch between. The point coordinate (absolute position) for a body centered atom would be \(a
        (1/2,1/2,1/2) \) and the fractional
        coordinate (relative position) would be \((1/2,1/2,1/2)\).

      <p>Consider the above fcc structure. If we take a look at any corner, we will find that the corner touches
        the 3 nearest face-centered atoms. These 4 atoms as shaded in the above figure, form a regular
        tetrahedron. A the center of the tetrahedron is a small space located at (1/4,1/4,1/4) relative to the corner
        atom. In this particular case,
        if we place our origin in the back-left-bottom corner, then the shaded corner atom is located at (1,1,1) and the
        tetrahedral center (red atom) is located at (3/4,3/4,3/4). By using the coordinates of these two atoms, it is
        easy
        to calculate the size of the tetrahedral space. This is worked out for you in another lesson.</p>
