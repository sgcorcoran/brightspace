      <h2>Predicting Ceramic Structures</h2>
      <h3>Cation/Anion Ratio and Coordination Number</h3>
      <p>The coordination number (CN) of a ceramic depends on the ratio of the radii of cation to anion:</p>

          <h4>Coordination Number (CN)</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="courseware-card-body">
          The term <em>Coordination Number (CN)</em> refers to the number of nearest neighbor ions of opposite charge
            surrounding a given ion in a ceramic structure. The CN is determined by the cation/anion radius ratio in accordance with the table given above.
          <p>For the ceramic, \(\text{ZnS}\) we have \( r_{Zn^{2+}} = 0.074 \, nm \) and \( r_{S^{2-}} = 0.184 \, nm \).</p>
          The ratio of ionic radii is therefore: \( \frac{0.074}{0.184} = 0.402 \) which from the table above indicates a CN = 4 which is the tetrahedral structure.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Predicting the Structure of \(\text{ZnS}\)</h3>
      <p>For ZnS, the CN is 4 as shown in the aside. A CN of 4 indicates a tetrahedral structure, i.e. the zinc ion is surrounded by 4 sulfur ions.  </p>
      <p><strong>There are 8 possible tetrahedral sites</strong> available in the FCC structure as shown in figure (a) below. If all 8 sites were filled with \(Zn^{2+}\), we would have 8 zinc ions but only 4 sulfur ions (8 corners * 1/8 + 6 faces * 1/2) per unit cell. This is a 2:1 ratio of ions but ZnS as written has a 1:1 ratio so we need <strong>only fill 4 of the 8 tetrahedral sites</strong>.  
        <p>This leaves us with several choices, two of which are shown as (b) and (c) below.  To minimize the repulsive energy, we want to <strong>maximize the distance between the Zn ions</strong>.  The best choice for this is given in the last structure (C). </p>

        <figcaption>Possible structures for ZnS that satisfy a CN = 4.  <strong>(a)</strong> All 8 tetrahedral sites are filled. This gives a 2:1 ratio of ions (8 zinc, 4 sulur) but the formula ZnS is in the ratio 1:1 so this is not the correct structure.  
          <strong>(b)</strong> 4 of the 8 sites are filled giving the correct 1:1 ratio but we can do a better job at keeping the zinc ions away from each other. <strong>(c) This is the correct structure. 
          We now have the correct 1:1 ratio and we have maximized the distance between the zinc ions.</strong></figcaption>

<h2>Calculating the Density of Ceramic Structures</h2>
      <h3>Calculating the Density, \(\rho\), of Ceramics</h3>
      <p>Givens: \( n_i \) is the number of ions of type \(i\) in the unit cell, \( A_i \) is the atomic mass, \(\frac{g}{mole}\) of each ion type, and \( N_A \) is Avogadro's
        number, \(\frac{ions}{mole}\). The quantity \(\frac{A_i}{N_A}\) is therefore the <strong>grams per ion</strong> of type \( i \).  If we multiply this quantify by the number of ions in the unit cell according to their types and sum, we will get the total number of grams contained in the unit cell.
        \[\sum_i{\frac{A_i\cdot n_i}{N_A}}=\frac{\text{total grams}}{\text{unit cell}}\]
        The density is just the number of grams contained within a given volume or in our case the number of grams per unit cell volume, \(a^3\). 
        \[\rho=\sum_i{\frac{A_i\cdot n_i}{N_A \cdot V_c}}=\sum_i{\frac{A_i\cdot n_i}{N_A \cdot a^3}}\]  where \(a\) is the cubic unit cell edge length.

        <h2>Mechanical Properties</h2>
        <h3>Effect of Porosity on the Elastic Modulus</h3>
        <p>Porosity significantly influences the mechanical properties of ceramics, including both strength and stiffness. As the porosity increases, the material becomes less dense, and internal voids act as stress concentrators, leading to reduced mechanical performance. This effect is particularly pronounced for the elastic modulus and flexural strength of ceramics.</p>
      
        <p>The effective elastic modulus of a porous ceramic can be estimated using the empirical relation:</p>
        <p>\[ E_{\text{porous}} = E_0 (1 - 1.9P + 0.9P^2) \]</p>
        <ul>
          <li>\( E_0 \) is the modulus of the non-porous material.</li>
          <li>\( P \) is the porosity fraction (0 ≤ \( P \) < 1).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="courseware-callout courseware-callout-standard">
        <h4>Example Calculation: Elastic Modulus</h4>
        <p>Consider a ceramic material with a non-porous modulus of \( E_0 = 200 \, GPa \) and a porosity of \( P = 0.1 \). We can calculate the effective modulus as follows:</p>
        <p>\[
        E_{\text{porous}} = 200 \, GPa \times (1 - 1.9 \times 0.1 + 0.9 \times (0.1)^2)
        \]</p>
        <p>Simplifying the expression:</p>
        <p>\[
        E_{\text{porous}} = 200 \, GPa \times (1 - 0.19 + 0.009) = 200 \, GPa \times 0.819 = 163.8 \, GPa
        \]</p>
        
          <p>The effective elastic modulus of the ceramic with 10% porosity is approximately 18.1% lower than the fully dense material.</p> <p><em>How would the modulus of a 30% porous sample compare to the fully dense case? Is this effect linear?</p></em>
        </div>
      
        <h3>Empirical Plots of Flexural Strength and Elastic Modulus vs. Porosity</h3>
        <p>Empirical data often show a linear or exponential decrease in both flexural strength and elastic modulus with increasing porosity. The figures below illustrate these trends for typical ceramics.</p>

          <figcaption>These empirical plots illustrate the decrease in mechanical properties such as flexural strength and Young's modulus as the porosity increases.</figcaption>
        </div>
        <h3>Effect of Porosity on Flexural Strength</h3>
<p>The flexural strength of ceramics decreases exponentially with increasing porosity. The relationship can be described using the empirical formula:</p>
<p>\[
\sigma_{\! f} = \sigma_0\, e^{-bP}
\]</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\sigma_f\): Flexural strength of the porous ceramic</li>
  <li>\(\sigma_0\): Flexural strength of the fully dense (non-porous) ceramic</li>
  <li>\(P\): Porosity fraction (0 ≤ \( P \) < 1)</li>
  <li>\(b\): Empirical constant (typically between 3 and 6 for most ceramics)</li>
</ul>
<p>This equation illustrates that even a small increase in porosity can significantly reduce the flexural strength of ceramics, particularly for high values of the empirical constant \(b\).</p>
