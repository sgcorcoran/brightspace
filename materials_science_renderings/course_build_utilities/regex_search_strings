\.\./assets/media/[^/]+/  

Here's a breakdown of the pattern:
\.\./ matches the literal ../
assets/media/ matches the literal assets/media/
[^/]+ matches any sequence of characters that are not / (to allow for Chap%2003 or any other string).
The final / matches the closing slash after the dynamic part.
This will match paths like ../assets/media/Chap%2003/, ../assets/media/any_string/, etc.
