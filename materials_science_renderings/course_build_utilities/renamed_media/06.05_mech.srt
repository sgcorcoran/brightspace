1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:08,400
uh in chapter 6 mechanical behavior

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,679
and we're going to look today at some

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,799
additional

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,560
elastic constants still

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:21,039
in the elastic region

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,880
of space so let me go ahead and first

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,160
correct this slide

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,279
this should say sigma

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,720
font got messed up here and called s so

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,399
again we're going to have a sample that

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,160
we've pulled on where

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,760
we're originally at l0 and we stretch it

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,800
to l here an attention test

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,360
okay so we know that we can define our

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,440
strain

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,600
in the direction of pull we're going to

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,960
now be more specific and call that the z

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,719
direction

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,920
so that axial strain is then again just

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,800
this change in length

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,680
over the original length

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
but when we do that the sample doesn't

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,760
maintain the same

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,600
volume most of the time the volume of

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,720
the sample overall will increase

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,600
somewhat

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,200
as we're stretching bonds but at the

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,400
same time that we're stretching in one

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,759
dimension

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,759
the sample will typically

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,000
shrink in the other dimensions

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,360
all right so if this was a rod then it

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,479
would be shrinking in the

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,680
radial direction all right so

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:35,200
we can also talk about a delta l

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,799
or delta w here we'll call call it width

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,520
so we can take again the final width

38
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,560
minus the original width over the

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,840
original width so

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,200
you can see it's the same definition

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,119
it's just now that this lateral now

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,520
strain is going to end up a negative

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,960
quantity if we're pulling in tension

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,320
if we're pushing compression then it

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,040
would grow and we'd end up with a

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,640
positive

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,600
lateral strain okay so this is my axial

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,119
strain

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:10,319
in the direction of pull and this is my

50
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:13,360
lateral strain in the lateral directions

51
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,680
and if we take the lateral strain value

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,360
and divide that by the axial strain

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,800
value

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,200
and then we're going to put a negative

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,680
sign out here that's going to cancel

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
with the negative signs in these

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,800
lateral strains so that we have a

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
positive quantity

59
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
this is referred to as the poisson's

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,200
ratio

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,599
and this symbol here is not a v but it's

62
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,120
actually the greek letter nu

63
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,120
so that's our poisson ratio

64
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,760
so here's a chart of the values for the

65
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,080
poissons ratio

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,239
as you can condense you again the sample

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,280
you can see again the cluster

68
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,400
into different classes of materials but

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,560
take a look at the

70
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,319
range of the poisson's ratio you can see

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,080
that it seems to have a limit of about

72
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,760
0.5

73
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,400
right and we do have some materials

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,879
dropping off here below 0.1

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,800
but really most of them seem to be you

76
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,760
know somewhere in this sort of 0.2 to

77
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,040
0.5 region

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,040
we could roughly

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:23,360
say that the metals are somewhere

80
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,360
at about 0.33 or a third

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,519
you can see the elastomers are very

82
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,640
close to 0.5 value

83
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,280
polymers around .4

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,319
so what's the significance of these

85
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,480
values

86
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:43,760
this .5 value is the case for

87
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,760
an incompressible

88
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,640
solid okay so this is

89
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,120
where the change in volume is

90
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,680
essentially zero

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,159
all right so ideally right at point five

92
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,080
the

93
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,439
amount that you stretch the sample the

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,200
one dimension

95
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,439
will get countered by the amount that

96
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,519
it's contracting laterally so that the

97
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,000
overall volume of the sample

98
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,720
does not change okay so a lot of

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
biomaterials fall into this category

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:18,079
and the and our last numbers do

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,040
and then as we get below that value the

102
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,000
volume is increasing so as we move this

103
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,240
way

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,160
delta v change in volume is greater than

105
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,400
zero

106
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,600
okay so we're not quite contracting as

107
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,960
much as we are

108
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
are stretching but you you can see from

109
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
this chart

110
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,199
you know this idea that metals are about

111
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,080
a third is not great

112
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,160
but you will see in almost all textbooks

113
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,479
if we don't have a

114
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,560
number for a metal or an alloy and we

115
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,759
just want a quick calculation

116
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,440
that people use a third all the time

117
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,840
we can see for the polymers though the

118
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,840
convention would be to use

119
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
0.4

120
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,440
and then if we go ahead and take a look

121
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,400
now at the shear modulus

122
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,160
the young's modulus and the poisson

123
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,720
ratio you can see that they're not

124
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,400
independent of each other if i know any

125
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,400
two then i can get to the third

126
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,520
so again this is for linear elastic

127
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,039
behavior

128
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,560
for isotropic materials

129
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,039
so this particular equation doesn't take

130
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,400
into account the anisotropy that might

131
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,800
come off if we were looking at a single

132
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,800
crystal

133
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,840
all right sorry about this this note

134
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,720
we're not using the ces software this

135
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,039
summer

136
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,240
so here's the value of the shear moduli

137
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,960
you'll see that they're not much

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,479
different

139
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,479
than the elastic moduli you can see that

140
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,280
from this equation let's say that nu was

141
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,880
something like a third

142
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,400
right then this would be e

143
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,800
over something like you know 2.6

144
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,160
and so we're we expect the shear moduli

145
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
to be

146
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,680
you know a factor of of two or three

147
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,840
different from the

148
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,360
elastic modulus but not orders of

149
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,840
magnitude different

150
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,960
and so they're fairly similar again the

151
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,360
materials

152
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:21,840
um group very nicely when we plot this

153
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,840
versus density
