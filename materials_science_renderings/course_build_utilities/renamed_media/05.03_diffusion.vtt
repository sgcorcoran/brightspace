00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.680
all right welcome to part three of

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.160
chapter five diffusion in solids

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.120
so we've learned about the mechanism of

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.240
diffusion

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.960
vacancy and interstitial we learned a

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.400
little bit about why it's important

7
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.920
and we'll learn a lot more about that as

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.680
we get into chapter 10.

9
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.600
and now we'd like to do is discuss how

10
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.600
we can predict the rate of diffusion

11
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.320
all right so the rate of diffusion is

12
00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.000
quantified by

13
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.120
fick's first law and this

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.040
equation which i don't have on here

15
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.760
quite yet but this is getting close

16
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.000
is found was found experimentally okay

17
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.280
so it's an empirical equation

18
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.200
so first we're going to do is let's just

19
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.360
go ahead and define the

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.520
rate of diffusion so the rate of

21
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.360
diffusion is going to be

22
00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.480
mass moving through an area

23
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.239
per unit of time so kilograms meters

24
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.320
squared per second

25
00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.600
or it might be moles per centimeter

26
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.560
squared per second so

27
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.960
stuff per area per time that's what we

28
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.840
call flux and referred to as j

29
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.840
that's our rate

30
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.119
all right so the basic experiment then

31
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.400
was to

32
00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.360
take a thin membrane impose a

33
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.320
concentration

34
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.840
across the membrane and then measure how

35
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.360
fast

36
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.600
molecules atoms move from one side of

37
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.880
the membrane to the other

38
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.200
and what's observed is that the greater

39
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.439
this concentration difference

40
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.119
the faster the flux faster we move

41
00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.960
things through

42
00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.000
and the greater this separation

43
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.920
delta x the slower

44
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.840
we move things through which hopefully

45
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.240
makes sense right if we make this

46
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.079
twice as thick then we've got twice as

47
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.920
far to move stuff

48
00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.920
and ultimately what's important is

49
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.000
actually the gradient here

50
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.360
so it's a delta c delta x or dc dx

51
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.640
so the flux is proportional to

52
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.119
the gradient dc dx and then all we have

53
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.080
to do

54
00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.000
is put a proportionality constant in

55
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.120
between these

56
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.040
and we get fixed first law of diffusion

57
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.040
and then d here is referred to as the

58
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.200
diffusion coefficient

59
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.280
and many times you'll hear me refer to

60
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.440
it as the diffusivity

61
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.720
so two names for the diffusion

62
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.519
coefficient

63
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.680
or the diffusivity all right so you

64
00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.920
could double check the units here

65
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.840
but d is going to be in something like

66
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.879
uh centimeters squared per second

67
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.959
or meters squared per second c

68
00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.959
is a concentration so that's going to be

69
00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.319
in like kilograms per

70
00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.840
meter cubed right so an amount per

71
00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:55.360
volume and then x of course is in

72
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.480
meters so that'll give you a flux

73
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.840
of kilograms per meter squared per

74
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.879
second

75
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.519
all right in steady state conditions

76
00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.440
the concentration gradient here doesn't

77
00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.879
change with time

78
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.080
okay and so in steady state conditions

79
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.480
this dc dx

80
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:19.200
term then just becomes a delta c delta x

81
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.920
so we'll be given the high concentration

82
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.440
and low concentration values

83
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.879
and we'll be given the thickness of a

84
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.560
membrane so we can just calculate this

85
00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.480
and then given the diffusivity which

86
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.879
simply depends on the material that

87
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.959
we're

88
00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.599
diffusing through we can come up with

89
00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.599
the flux

90
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.959
so let's look at a simple example so

91
00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:47.840
here is um say we have a pair of

92
00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.400
gloves and we're worried about the

93
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.080
movement of methylene chloride

94
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.599
which is in a paint remover through the

95
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.400
glove

96
00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:59.439
okay if we were to use a butyl rubber

97
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.720
glove which is not a good choice

98
00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.239
let's go ahead and take a look at that

99
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.280
though we've got a thickness of the

100
00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.720
glove at about 0.04 centimeters

101
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.400
and we'd like to know how much of this

102
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.640
methylene chloride is coming through

103
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.599
okay so here's our picture we have paint

104
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.320
remover

105
00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.560
we've got a glove protecting our skin

106
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.000
and we've got our skin now in this glove

107
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.959
just kind of immersed in the paint

108
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.479
thinner

109
00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.639
and this is going to be a fix for a

110
00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.199
small problem we're going to assume

111
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.639
a linear gradient because the problem is

112
00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.800
given to us as a steady state problem

113
00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.440
we'll get to non-steady state problems

114
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.360
in a in a bit

115
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.960
so let's say you were to go ahead and

116
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.400
use this for

117
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.040
a few hours let's see what happens with

118
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.080
the amount

119
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.840
of paint of the methylene chloride that

120
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.040
comes through

121
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.040
okay so one of the things has to be

122
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.560
given is a diffusivity so this is the

123
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.360
diffusivity

124
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.280
for methylene chloride through butyl

125
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.400
rubber okay so that's a given or it's in

126
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.520
a table

127
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.160
110 times 10 to the minus eight

128
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.919
centimeters square per second and we're

129
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.400
given the high concentration and low

130
00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.880
concentration values

131
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.520
these depend on the environment and

132
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.360
we're given

133
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.880
the fact that the globe thickness is

134
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.080
0.04

135
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.880
so you can see here we're just simply

136
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.160
plugging in and we end up with

137
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.639
about 1 times 10 to the minus 5 grams

138
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.759
per centimeter squared per second

139
00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.479
all right let me just say something

140
00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:30.320
about this negative sign here

141
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.360
this negative sign is important and it

142
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.320
refers to the direction of the flux

143
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.639
so when i have a gradient as shown so

144
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.960
this is a negative gradient

145
00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.800
right that we're dropping as we move

146
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.280
along in x direction

147
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.000
this is a negative gradient the flux

148
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.440
moves

149
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.360
in this direction it moves in the

150
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.039
positive x direction so that's a

151
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.680
positive flux

152
00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.199
so that's where this negative comes from

153
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.199
so i have to be careful when i do my

154
00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:01.039
delta c term here

155
00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:02.560
right that i'm doing c2 minus c1

156
00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.160
we're always going to assume that our

157
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.960
x-axis is positive

158
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.080
as it points to the right so if i was to

159
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.319
reverse

160
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.479
this picture put my skin on this side

161
00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.639
the paint remover over here

162
00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.520
and now my gradient would look like this

163
00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:22.880
which is actually a positive gradient

164
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:25.039
okay i'd still do c2 minus c1

165
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.960
okay i get a positive number i'd end up

166
00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.639
with a negative flux

167
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.960
negative flux meaning that my flux is

168
00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.240
now moving to the left

169
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.680
so the so that negative sign is

170
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.560
important you can't just simply get rid

171
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.639
of it

172
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.720
all the time it depends upon your

173
00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.280
coordinate system and how you've chosen

174
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.560
to set up your sketch all right but

175
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.680
let's go ahead and look at this answer a

176
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.960
little bit

177
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.440
when it's normalized to an area

178
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.440
it's not clear exactly what this means

179
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.120
so it's considered the glove

180
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.120
if we take a a good you know

181
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.520
medium-sized glove

182
00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.639
you can estimate the surface area to be

183
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.120
something like 200 centimeters squared

184
00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.400
okay so if we go ahead and plug that in

185
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.120
and then let's say we're

186
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.199
using the paint thinner for three hours

187
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.759
okay so we'll multiply by three hours

188
00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.840
we multiplied by 200 centimeters squared

189
00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.720
so these units cancel

190
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.280
and we're left with 25 grams which is

191
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.280
quite a bit

192
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.360
all right so next time we're going to do

193
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.680
is look at

194
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.039
the role of temperature or answer how

195
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.120
does diffusion

196
00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:33.120
depend upon temperature
