1
00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.440
last time we took a look at the stress

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.320
strain curve and idealized case and we

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.760
defined the tensile strength yield

4
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.799
strength

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.000
strain the fracture and the young's

6
00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.320
modulus

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.600
so this time i just wanted to show you

8
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.920
uh three cases

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.359
of real data so this is some data taken

10
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.279
out of a book by

11
00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:31.679
professor dowling so here we have the

12
00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:34.719
tensile data on a 1020 steel

13
00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.000
and you can see that

14
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.520
on the top plot here we've got again

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.719
this is steel so we're looking at

16
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.840
something like a 37 percent

17
00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.840
strain and fracture

18
00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.760
you can go ahead and get the tensile

19
00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.120
strength on here so the

20
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.239
maximum stress value that the sample

21
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.000
sees

22
00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.000
and then if we want to take a look at

23
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.640
the young's modulus and yield strength

24
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.719
we're going to need to expand this

25
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.240
region here

26
00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.159
and that's we've got plotted down below

27
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.880
and now we can go ahead and we can pull

28
00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.880
off the slope

29
00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:18.320
here and we can get

30
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.439
you can see here 201 000

31
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.240
and that would be in units megapascals

32
00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:29.360
so that means it's 201.2

33
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.960
gigapascals so that's our modulus

34
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.479
we can come over to the 0.002

35
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.680
offset right we just follow the same

36
00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.119
slope

37
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.280
and where we intersect here

38
00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.280
is our yield strength 264

39
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
megapascals

40
00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.479
all right if we were to continue on in

41
00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.079
this area

42
00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:59.360
and we were to unload at some point

43
00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:02.960
the unloading slope would follow

44
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.360
the elastic modulus okay so we would get

45
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.280
some

46
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.360
recovered strain so this strain here in

47
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.920
this little piece is a recovered strain

48
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.040
it's the elastic strain

49
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.239
and then the plastic strain would

50
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.599
correspond to the

51
00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:23.520
the remainder the strain

52
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.280
um the plastic strain plus that

53
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.680
elastic strain i'll go ahead and keep

54
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.680
this is

55
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.560
sub e instead of recovered uh plastic

56
00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.599
strain plus elastic strain

57
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.440
is the strain under load

58
00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.000
okay so that would correspond to this

59
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.040
point the strain under load

60
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.319
and say equals here

61
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.080
all right so the other thing we can see

62
00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.160
with the steel you can see that there's

63
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.400
also an upper yield point

64
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.360
and then it does drop off a bit this one

65
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.280
doesn't show that

66
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.440
kind of jagged or serrated yielding that

67
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.319
we saw in the other case

68
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.640
but you can see again that that it does

69
00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.920
have this upper and lower yield point

70
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.640
and that our rule falls into this lower

71
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.800
yield point region

72
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.519
all right the actual data that came out

73
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.720
was a force that was applied

74
00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.720
and there was also

75
00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.239
the displacement of the sample

76
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.519
and that's already been turned into a

77
00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.519
strain value for us

78
00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.200
uh take a look now at an aluminum alloy

79
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.519
this is a

80
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.959
high-strength aluminum alloy used in

81
00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.400
aircraft

82
00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.000
and this one's plotted a little bit

83
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.319
different instead of having a separate

84
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.599
plot for the initial region

85
00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.720
it includes both plots on one

86
00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.599
and so you have to just be a little

87
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.599
careful at trying to read this one

88
00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:54.560
so curve 2 here is the overall curve and

89
00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.599
that uses the top axis

90
00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.519
and so we can see that our

91
00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:04.640
strain at fracture is about fifteen

92
00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.799
point three percent and we were at about

93
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.400
thirty seven percent for the steel

94
00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.920
now we're about fifteen point three

95
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.959
percent

96
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.000
and the tensile strength say is about

97
00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.720
600

98
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.840
megapascals and then we can go ahead

99
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.720
and take a look at this

100
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.720
initial region

101
00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.840
that's what's plotted here using the

102
00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:33.360
bottom scale

103
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.800
so now we can pull off the elastic

104
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.759
modulus

105
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.000
nice and easy on this one and you can

106
00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:44.080
see here this 415 over .0065

107
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.160
let me just show you this is the point

108
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.000
that's being used

109
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.800
so they're actually pulling the slope

110
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.800
off like this

111
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.479
and we get 68.6

112
00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.600
gigapascals all right

113
00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:04.240
and then uh let's see what else

114
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.199
the yield strengths this particular case

115
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.639
the yield strength

116
00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.560
this would be a 0.2 right so we'd have

117
00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.680
to kind of follow

118
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.199
this curve up so we can keep the same

119
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.039
slope here

120
00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.240
and then my intersection would be here

121
00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:22.360
so this is looking like

122
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.520
it's uh well probably about 540

123
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.639
megapascals

124
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.440
or something for the yield strength

125
00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.080
that's a rough estimate based on my free

126
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.080
handing here

127
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.639
all right

128
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.280
also if we wanted to take a look at the

129
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.320
strain

130
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.199
after fracture so we got the strain at

131
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.360
fracture which is this point

132
00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.199
and then if we imagine unloading at that

133
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.240
the curve at that point and followed the

134
00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.120
same

135
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.199
slope as our elastic modulus we get some

136
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.840
elastic recovery

137
00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.000
and we could define then a plastic

138
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.080
strain

139
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.280
after fracture so the plastic strain

140
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.800
after fracture

141
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.319
is equal to the strain at fracture

142
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.720
minus hooke's law minus the elastic

143
00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:16.720
strain that's recovered and that just

144
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.960
simply comes from

145
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.600
from hooke's law and that's what this

146
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.639
line here is it's just a plot of hooke's

147
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.000
law

148
00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.680
and so we can put that in and we can

149
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.280
calculate

150
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:35.840
that this plastic strain after fracture

151
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.840
is 14.5 percent

152
00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.440
and then here's an example the cast iron

153
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.319
you can see that

154
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.240
this is non-linear we don't have a

155
00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:50.080
linear region on this

156
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.800
we can see that our strain is less than

157
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.639
1.2 percent so this would be considered

158
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.120
brittle anything less than about 5

159
00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.199
percent

160
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.520
elongation to fracture is considered

161
00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.520
brittle

162
00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:04.560
and this particular one you can also see

163
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.120
well you can't see from this curve but

164
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.080
this doesn't go plastic it just

165
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.280
stays non-linear elastic and then we get

166
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.880
failure

167
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:18.240
fracture all right so let's go ahead

168
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.360
let me just one more word note the axes

169
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.800
just be careful this is in percent units

170
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.680
this one here was also in percent units

171
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.319
and this first one that we did is

172
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.360
dimensionless it's not in percent

173
00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:34.400
okay so be careful of the axis for the

174
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.479
stream

175
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.840
all right so let's just compare the

176
00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:39.680
three of those because we're going to

177
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.800
plot the stress straight curves

178
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.000
all in the same plot we start to get a

179
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.039
visual picture for what's

180
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.720
going on in these materials so you can

181
00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:53.759
see right away that the steel

182
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.800
i think this is our steel

183
00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:59.360
you can see that it has a lot of energy

184
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.960
under this curve so this whole shaded in

185
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.479
region

186
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:08.319
that's in here is an energy

187
00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:12.800
it's a stress times strain

188
00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:14.560
value and pascals if you convert

189
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.960
that unit you'll see that you'll get the

190
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.840
joules per centimeter cubed and so it's

191
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.800
a

192
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.520
energy per volume and that's what it

193
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.039
takes to

194
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:28.160
break that sample 130 joules

195
00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:31.199
per centimeter cubed okay so that's a

196
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:35.760
fairly ductile material you can see the

197
00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:38.479
strained fracture out here at 37

198
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:43.200
compared to say the aluminum case where

199
00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:44.720
our strain is at 15.3 percent

200
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.560
but you can see this aluminum alloy

201
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:50.320
actually has very high strength

202
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:53.760
tensile strength as compared to the

203
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.839
steel case still has a

204
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.600
reasonable ductility measure or energy

205
00:08:55.839 --> 00:08:59.760
to fracture

206
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.360
especially if we compare now to the

207
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.760
chaos to iron which is

208
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:07.680
all the way in here so anything

209
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.560
to the right of this five percent would

210
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.839
be considered brittle

211
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:18.160
and you can see in here at one point

212
00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:18.160
two percent or so is the cast iron

213
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.120
all right all right so next time we'll

214
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:27.040
go ahead and take a look at the

215
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.040
hardness test
