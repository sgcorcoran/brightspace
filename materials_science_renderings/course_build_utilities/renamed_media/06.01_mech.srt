1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,879
all right before watching this video

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,520
uh on mechanical behavior this is part

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,160
one

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,920
of chapter six you wanna go ahead and

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,639
watch the youtube video

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,480
that shows a pencil testing of a

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,400
stainless steel

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,840
sampling explains the use of an

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,920
extensometer

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,920
and how the stress strain curve is taken

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,560
that's in canvas for for your

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,560
convenience

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,719
all right just a reminder that in the

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,120
beginning of chapter six you will find

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,760
the

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,280
learning objectives and we will take a

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,040
look at all these learning objectives

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,480
throughout this chapter

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,399
the exception uh being true stress and

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,680
true stream

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,200
that is a little bit later in the

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,879
chapter so you don't have to worry about

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,079
this learning objective

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,160
we are going to be sticking with

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,600
engineering stress and engineering

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,160
strain which i'm going to go ahead and

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,160
define

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,079
all right so um we could talk about a

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,600
tension test or we could talk about a

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,760
compression test

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,320
and just the reverse of the applied

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,680
force so an attention test we're

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,520
we're pulling on the sample we're

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,000
stretching the sample and changing its

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,640
length

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
increasing its length and we would get

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,640
some

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,400
change in length delta l if we take a

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,439
look at the length minus the original

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,080
length

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,119
and if we were to take that delta l and

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,200
divide it by this original length

43
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,400
then we would have the definition here

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,560
of strain

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,320
okay so it's dimensionless it's a length

46
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,159
over a length

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,000
for compression that would be exactly

48
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,439
the same thing except delta l would end

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
up as a negative number and we would

50
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,320
have a negative strain value

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,079
the stress is defined as negative when

52
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,960
when it's in compression that's just

53
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,960
as a convention

54
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,600
and the stress is defined as that

55
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,439
applied force

56
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,719
divided by the initial cross-sectional

57
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,520
area and that would be in units of

58
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,520
pascals

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,800
shear stress and shear strain are

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,760
defined as the distortion

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,400
in the sample so if we have a cubic

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,480
block

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
say for example and we were to apply a

64
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,400
shear stress to the surface

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,560
this is kind of like having a deck of

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,239
cards and pulling on the bottom of the

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,760
deck and pushing on the top of the deck

68
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,879
you create a sheer

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,360
and it distorts the shape

70
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,160
of the original deck and so we would

71
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,120
define

72
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,200
that distortion that delta l for the

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,879
change in length

74
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,239
as defined in this figure over the

75
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,280
original length as our shear strain

76
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,760
that's also the tangent of the angle of

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
distortion

78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,440
the shear stress is also defined as the

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,560
force divided by that original

80
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
area it's just now that that area is now

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,599
parallel

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,360
so in the deck of cards example the

83
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,840
force is applied to the face

84
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,840
of that top card and bottom card that

85
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
would be your original area
