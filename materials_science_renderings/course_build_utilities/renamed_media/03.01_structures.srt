00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,360
chapter three structure of crystalline

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,200
solids

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,799
so today we're going to take a look at

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,880
the structure

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,639
last time we took a look at the atomic

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,360
structure otherwise the bonding

7
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,559
between atoms we talked about primary

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,800
bond types

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,039
hopefully you can name three and we

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,320
talked about secondary bond types

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,320
today we're going to talk about the

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,840
atomic arrangement

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,240
of atoms how do the atoms pack to form a

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,160
crystal structure

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,079
the reason we're interested in

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,120
structures that structure directly

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,760
affects

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,800
properties and then ultimately we're

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,559
going to see

20
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,680
as we move through the course many

21
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,680
different ways of processing a material

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,879
and the processing ultimately will

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,920
affect structure

24
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,920
so ultimately affect properties

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,520
so understanding the structure property

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,280
relationship

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,120
and how processing affects structure

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,559
would help us tailor materials for

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,160
specific uses

30
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,640
so you can you can grow your own crystal

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,000
structures if you want alums a good

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,799
system to grow those are

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,159
very nice big crystals and these are an

34
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,400
alum that's just a spice

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,479
in your grocery store one of the things

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,360
you notice when you grow a single

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,360
crystal

38
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,400
and say this piece here is a single

39
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,240
crystal

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,040
right there's another one each of these

41
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,799
is a single crystal

42
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,479
so all the atoms in these different

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,479
pieces have the same structure and

44
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,840
they're all oriented the same way

45
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,560
one of the things you'll notice is that

46
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,720
their angles here

47
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,920
will show up and repeat in the different

48
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,759
structures

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,439
so the lengths of edges might change in

50
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,320
length but the angles are always the

51
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,119
same

52
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,560
so that implies there's some order to

53
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,560
the arrangement of the atoms

54
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,759
the two types that we're going to look

55
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,439
at is what's called face centered cubic

56
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,600
and body centered cubic that's where

57
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,680
we're going to focus this class

58
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,920
and you can see many of the common

59
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
metals have one of these two types of

60
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,719
structures

61
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,799
we're also going to talk just very

62
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,079
briefly about the hexagonal close pack

63
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,840
system

64
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,200
but we're going to focus all of our

65
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,039
calculations

66
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,080
on the face centered fcc or bcc

67
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,760
body centered so let's first take a look

68
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,000
at the face centered cubic

69
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,360
as you can see the face centered cubic

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,080
structure

71
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,360
first it's a cube cubic so we've got

72
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,400
atoms

73
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,200
forming the cube here

74
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,480
if i look at the positions of the atom's

75
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,080
centers

76
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,160
and then at the face of each cube

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,879
you have an atom so face centered cubic

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,360
there's another view of that and this is

79
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,560
showing you what the true unit cell is

80
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,000
that is the repeat unit and

81
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,000
it's showing you here now that we are

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
going indeed from the atom's centers

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,920
and so that's what's actually repeated

84
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,000
so if we continue

85
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,680
to add in more and more pieces we can

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,720
see that we build up

87
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:07,599
this face-centered cubic structure

88
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,200
all right so a couple of things we want

89
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,239
to know about when we're looking at the

90
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,879
structures

91
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,599
we want to know about how efficient the

92
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,680
atoms are packed into the structure

93
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,360
and how much of that is how much of this

94
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,720
unit cell is space

95
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,840
and how much of it is atom

96
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,840
and we want to know something about how

97
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,840
to find

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:35,040
the length of the cube edge

99
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,799
in terms of the radius

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,400
r of our atoms okay so first thing let's

101
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,920
go ahead and take a look at the number

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,040
of atoms per unit cell

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,040
okay we have listed here four and how do

104
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,159
we get that

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,120
so we've got if we take a look at our

106
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,879
cell up here you can see that we've got

107
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,760
a half of an atom

108
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,760
here at the face

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,239
okay and there are six faces

110
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,519
times one half of an atom for each face

111
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,239
center

112
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560
so that's three atoms and then notice

113
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,720
that

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
the atoms on the corners are actually an

115
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,680
eighth of an atom

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
and there's eight corners

117
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,919
so that's one atom and so we have

118
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:28,240
four complete atom volumes

119
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:31,440
in one of our unit cells

120
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,479
so we've got four atoms

121
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,759
per area

122
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,880
cubed of our unit cell right

123
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,560
our volume of our unit cell is just

124
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,199
a cubed so let's find

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,080
a the edge length here so what we're

126
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,560
going to do to find a

127
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,400
is we want to take a look at our space

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,759
filling model again

129
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,560
and locate where the atoms are touching

130
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,280
so notice in the face centered system

131
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,280
the atoms

132
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,600
are touching along the face diagonals

133
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,280
and so what that tells me is that i've

134
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,400
got one

135
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,400
two three 4r

136
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:20,160
4 radii and relative to a

137
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,759
if i draw my right triangle here i got a

138
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,039
a and so that 4r there the hypotenuse

139
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,919
is then just a square root 2.

140
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,360
okay so that gives me that a is equal to

141
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,560
4r

142
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,120
over the square root 2. so it's just

143
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,120
another way of writing

144
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,199
to r square root 2. i'm going to leave

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,199
it in this 4r square root 2 format

146
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,800
because you see this will be

147
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,680
similar to what we see for the body

148
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,320
centered cubic structure

149
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,560
so i like this format a little better

150
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,039
all right so the atomic packing factor

151
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,240
here how well to be packed is just

152
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,360
simply the

153
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,360
volume of atoms

154
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:08,560
over the volume of the unit cell

155
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,680
okay so it's the fractional amount of

156
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,800
atom per total volume

157
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,440
we said the volume of atoms well one

158
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,800
atom

159
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:23,120
is four thirds pi

160
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,280
r cubed and we've got four atoms total

161
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:30,479
in the unit cell

162
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,479
the volume of our unit cell is a cubed

163
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,680
and a remember we already have it

164
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,360
written up here

165
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,199
a is equal to 4r square root of 2.

166
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,960
okay so i'm going to put that in for r

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,800
square root 2 cubed

168
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,039
all right so you just go ahead and

169
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,000
simplify these numbers the r's cancel

170
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,479
out

171
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,520
plug the rest of this in your calculator

172
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,880
and you're going to get 0.74

173
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,000
so in other words this is 74 atom

174
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,639
26 percent then is space

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
in this unit cell this is actually the

176
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,440
best that we can do and so this is

177
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,560
referred to as a close

178
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,560
packed structure

179
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,039
the body centered cubic structure again

180
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,960
we've got a cube

181
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,639
okay we always call the edge length a

182
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,960
but now we don't have atoms in the face

183
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,240
but we have an atom sitting here in the

184
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,960
body's center

185
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,280
so body centered cubic it's non-close

186
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,280
packed

187
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,080
it's building up my structure the atomic

188
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,440
packing factor now or the packing

189
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,440
efficiency is 68

190
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:48,000
there's now two atoms in this unit cell

191
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,919
and the edge length now is four r over

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,599
the square root of three

193
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,639
and i'm going to leave these for you

194
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,639
to drive yourself

195
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,039
and then this is the right triangle

196
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,280
that's going to help you with this

197
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,280
okay so edge length a

198
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,720
this is across the face so that's a

199
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,720
square root 2.

200
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,800
and then this is our body diagonal

201
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,520
and i guess i'll go ahead and give that

202
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,599
to you a square root of 3

203
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,599
right body diagonal cube
