1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,240
uh so last time we defined stress and

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,200
strain

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,280
we defined hooke's law linear elastic

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,559
non-linear elastic

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,400
and we defined the elastic modulus or

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,679
young's modulus

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,600
so this time what i'm going to do is

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,119
just kind of

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,080
go ahead and basically relate where this

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,439
elastic modulus comes from so in this

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,080
elastic region

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,400
it's important to note that we are we

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,800
are not displacing

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,680
uh rows of atoms or planes of atoms

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,000
relative to another plane

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,920
like we would in plastic deformation

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,680
we're simply stretching

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,879
bonds so you recall this

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,879
hopefully this energy

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,039
plot here as we have two atoms

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,600
approaching each other

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,199
and we said that the atoms will sit down

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,399
here in this well

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,120
at an equilibrium separation

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,120
r0

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,119
and the bond energy e0 so when we start

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,880
elastically stretching

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,119
we're going to be let's say if we're in

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,159
tension we're going to be increasing

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,600
this equilibrium position

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,600
or we're going to be displacing the

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,759
atoms out of their equilibrium positions

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,159
what i should say

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,040
and then again if we and so that would

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,000
be us

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,920
walking say along this curve i'm really

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,520
exaggerating

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,439
the amount that we would walk along that

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,400
curve here but we'll be walking along

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,759
this curve here

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,759
as we stretch the sample

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,880
and then if we let go we would come back

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,040
to this equilibrium position

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,280
so another way to kind of see that is to

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,640
go ahead and take the

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,880
derivative of this energy

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:56,399
with respect to the separation

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:00,079
atomic separation r okay

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,320
and this is proportional to a force

50
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,200
and so that's what we have up here on

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,920
this top curve we have the force

52
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,319
okay and so if we take a look at the

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,319
slope

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,200
down here at our equilibrium position

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,200
you can see the slope is zero

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,680
so on our force curve you can see if we

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,920
end up with a with zero here

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,800
so this equilibrium value we had in the

59
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,879
energy curve

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
the other way to think about it is that

61
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,599
that's the location where the sum of the

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,120
forces

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,959
is equal to zero all right so if that's

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,879
the case

65
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,720
then if we were to take a look at the

66
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,680
slope

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,400
in here at this equilibrium position

68
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,160
where the sum of the forces is zero

69
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,760
then we now have a slope that looks like

70
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,080
a force versus separation in other words

71
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,200
this slope here should be

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,400
proportional to

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,879
the elastic modulus i'm just going to

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,200
spell that out so you don't think that e

75
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,360
means energy here so the slope nail is

76
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,840
proportional to the elastomodulus

77
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,519
it looks like our stress strain curve

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,879
we'd have to go through some conversions

79
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,800
to actually

80
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,239
get the elastic value because we are in

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,480
units of force

82
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,440
and atomic separation so we would need

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,400
to

84
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,000
figure out how to come up with an area

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,440
to make that a stress

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,120
and in what way and how we would come

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,120
about making this a strain value

88
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,760
but what we can do is at least in a

89
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,680
relative sense we can understand how

90
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,360
when we have one material that's very

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,720
strongly bound

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,400
so in the energy this would be the case

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,200
for the

94
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,159
high gonna try and avoid e here too many

95
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,519
e's

96
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,920
i'll just write bond energy all right we

97
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,840
talked about bond energy

98
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,360
so the strongly bound case would be

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,120
where the bond energy is

100
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,080
high this one is is the case for the

101
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,959
bond energy being

102
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,840
low or at least lower than the red curve

103
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,560
here

104
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,840
so more shallower well from the energy

105
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,720
plot

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,120
and so if you take a look at those what

107
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,000
you will find is that these slopes

108
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,959
at the equilibrium positions is much

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,840
steeper for the

110
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,600
strongly bound sample as compared to the

111
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,440
weekly bound sample

112
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,280
and so we would expect the strongly

113
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,880
bound sample

114
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,680
to have the higher elastic modulus

115
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,160
right or young's modulus so that'll be a

116
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,880
high elastic modulus

117
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,360
this other one here then would have the

118
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,040
lower

119
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:49,360
elastic modulus so the modulus

120
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,479
is proportional to again the derivative

121
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,560
of the force with respect to r evaluated

122
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,560
at that equilibrium position
