00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.040
all right welcome to

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.840
uh part four of this video series for

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.320
chapter five diffusion and solids

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.679
so so far we have talked about the

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.640
mechanism of diffusion

6
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.039
this is vacancy or interstitial we've

7
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.080
talked about why it's important

8
00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.720
an example of case hardening we talked

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.720
about

10
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.439
how to predict the rate of diffusion for

11
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.960
steady state using fixed first law

12
00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.640
now we'd like to talk about where the

13
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.119
temperature dependence

14
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.119
comes in

15
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.640
all right so temperature dependence is

16
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.840
in that diffusivity or diffusion

17
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.960
coefficient

18
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.039
in fixed first law okay and so this

19
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.280
diffusion coefficient

20
00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.960
is like a rate constant for the

21
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.079
diffusion process

22
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.320
and it has an arrhenius behavior exactly

23
00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.719
like the equation we had

24
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.000
for the number of vacancies and like you

25
00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.199
have seen before for chemical

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.160
kinetics so now my activation energy my

27
00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.840
barrier

28
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.400
is that for diffusion okay

29
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.040
again we would end up with a kt or in

30
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.200
this case an

31
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.520
rt r the gas constant on the bottom

32
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.560
rt is usually better here because q is

33
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.799
usually given

34
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.400
perhaps in joules per mole and so the

35
00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.600
gas constant

36
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.080
being in joules mole kelvin cancels our

37
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.640
units

38
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.640
so whether you use k or r here just

39
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.200
depends on the units that's given for

40
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.320
your

41
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.320
activation energy okay so this term

42
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.439
inside the exponential

43
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.119
has to be dimensionless all right and

44
00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.479
then we have a constant out front of the

45
00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.399
exponential so it's called the

46
00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.040
pre-exponential

47
00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.799
and this d0 and this activation

48
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.159
activation energy q

49
00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.880
are both independent of temperature

50
00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.040
so this is how we can then calculate the

51
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.320
diffusion coefficient

52
00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.000
at a given temperature and

53
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.640
important thing to notice is that it's

54
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.640
exponential

55
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.079
and this is particularly important if

56
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.840
you think about this

57
00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.119
and you if you go ahead and put in some

58
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.360
numbers here

59
00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.720
you'll find that room temperature d is

60
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.120
very small

61
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.760
so materials are stable they're not

62
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.480
moving around

63
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.560
at least not in our time frame and then

64
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.000
as we go to higher temperatures

65
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.400
this diffusion rate goes up

66
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.120
exponentially which allows us to now

67
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.080
move stuff

68
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.840
around move solid mass around

69
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.560
compositions around

70
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.160
in the solid state and so it allows for

71
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.160
a lot of processing methods

72
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.800
and so that's pretty neat if you think

73
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.840
about that ability

74
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.760
over a fairly small temperature window

75
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.680
of room temperature up to maybe a

76
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.760
thousand degrees c

77
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.959
and we go from stable materials to

78
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.640
materials where we can

79
00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.640
move mass around and process them

80
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.120
all right so in this particular plot

81
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.599
this is actually a good plot and then

82
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.519
let me just bring up a good point when

83
00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.680
you're doing your reading

84
00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.040
whenever you see a plot in the text and

85
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.959
you're doing your reading

86
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.560
you may want to look at what they're

87
00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.040
trying to show you

88
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.239
in the plot ask yourself why why are

89
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.400
they bothering to show you this

90
00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.000
particular plot

91
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.760
it's rare in most of the cases that

92
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.760
they're just trying to show you a value

93
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.959
it's always because they're trying to

94
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.680
show you some kind of a concept

95
00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.120
or some kind of a trend and so in this

96
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.920
particular case the thing

97
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.560
to kind of ask or notice is that it

98
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.000
looks like

99
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.760
carbon in iron

100
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.560
are fairly high in rate

101
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.360
over this temperature range and then

102
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.640
we've got sort of

103
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.480
iron and iron iron and alpha iron

104
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.720
aluminum and aluminum so these are

105
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.640
self-diffusion cases

106
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.239
and they seem to be fairly low at least

107
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.920
in comparison to these

108
00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.599
so you so if you notice this you might

109
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.360
ask why

110
00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.599
well this is showing you the difference

111
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.640
between interstitial diffusion

112
00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.159
which is the carbon case up here and

113
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.959
since these are self-diffusion then

114
00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.560
these have to be by a vacancy mechanism

115
00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.199
so we have vacancy here an interstitial

116
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.199
up here

117
00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.720
so you can see the interstitial

118
00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.040
mechanism being faster

119
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.199
like we said earlier now you can see it

120
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.560
in values

121
00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:30.400
this alpha iron versus gamma iron is

122
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.199
something that we'll get into a lot more

123
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.199
later but the alpha iron is your room

124
00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.479
temperature iron this is body centered

125
00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.520
cubic

126
00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.479
and gamma iron is a higher temperature

127
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.080
iron

128
00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.160
where you do most of your steel

129
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.520
processing and this is actually a face

130
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.840
centered cubic

131
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.759
material okay so you don't have to

132
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.280
memorize these for this chapter

133
00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:57.840
like i said we'll work with these a lot

134
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.840
more as we get into chapter 9.

135
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.639
all right so interstitial greater than

136
00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.400
substitutional

137
00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.400
substitutional meaning vacancy

138
00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.639
all right so let's look at a quick

139
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.759
example

140
00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:18.880
we have the activation energy

141
00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:20.800
given for diffusion case

142
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.320
we've also been given not the

143
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.800
pre-exponential

144
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.479
but the diffusion coefficient that's

145
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.520
this one

146
00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.120
at a particular temperature

147
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.720
and we like to know what the diffusion

148
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.600
coefficient is

149
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.919
at a different temperature 350 degrees c

150
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.919
all right so we could just go ahead and

151
00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.360
plug in

152
00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:48.000
our value here for d plug in for q

153
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.600
and then solve for d zero once we get

154
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.080
that we can then use the q

155
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.960
given the d zero we just found that the

156
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.199
new temperature

157
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.199
set of 350 calculate d

158
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.880
okay another way to do it

159
00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.479
is to go ahead and do all the equation

160
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.800
manipulation first

161
00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.840
see what we get and put in the numbers

162
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.280
at the end

163
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.600
so everything we're going to do here is

164
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.000
we're going to transform our

165
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.120
original equation by taking the natural

166
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.120
log of both sides

167
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.880
then we're going to subtract the two

168
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.880
equations from each other

169
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.840
and now we've got one equation that

170
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.000
will give us the diffusivity at some

171
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.880
temperature

172
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.319
if we know the diffusivity at a

173
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.080
different temperature

174
00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.080
so i can just plug straight into this

175
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.639
equation

176
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:49.599
make sure you're in kelvin we plug away

177
00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:51.759
and we get our new diffusivity so we

178
00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:53.759
change only from 300 to 350 that's a

179
00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.440
pretty minor change but you can see we

180
00:06:53.759 --> 00:07:03.520
about doubled

181
00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:03.520
the diffusivity value
