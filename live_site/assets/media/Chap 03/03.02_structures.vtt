1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.240
so let's take a look at

2
00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.600
the packing in a face-centered cubic

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.960
structure

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.120
so i've got here just kind of a little

5
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.759
demo that i wrote um

6
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.320
showing the face centered structure

7
00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.359
here's

8
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.560
for a single unit cell for example so

9
00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:23.359
you can see the cubic structure

10
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.920
and you can see that in the face of this

11
00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.920
cube

12
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.760
you've got an atom okay so a face

13
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.920
centered cubic structure

14
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.840
so we're going to add on a bunch more

15
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.440
unit cells so we can kind of build up

16
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.719
our crystal

17
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.600
and one of the things i want you to

18
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.360
notice is that depending upon

19
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.320
which direction we look at this crystal

20
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.120
we're going to have a different

21
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.520
placement

22
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.800
of atoms so for example

23
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.600
i just want to highlight the faces

24
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.480
so you can see the faces have this

25
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.559
square

26
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.039
geometry it looks like the 5 on the die

27
00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.920
but if i was to look say along one of

28
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.480
the

29
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.119
diagonals of this structure i'm going to

30
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.600
slice it in a different direction

31
00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.240
you can see now i've got again a nice

32
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.200
plane of atoms

33
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.880
but now they've got a triangular or if

34
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.479
you want to look in here you'll see that

35
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.600
there's a hexagonal

36
00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.920
pattern to the structure okay

37
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.759
so each direction that we were to slice

38
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.080
this material let me slice it yet again

39
00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.080
one more direction

40
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.119
this is now cutting off an edge you can

41
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.119
see that

42
00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.479
edge now also forms a plane when i cut

43
00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.159
that edge off

44
00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.320
and my atoms have again another

45
00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.159
symmetry that you don't see in the

46
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.720
others and different packing

47
00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.560
this is a very low density packing in

48
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.560
fact let me go ahead and remove

49
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.399
the atoms so i can just look at the

50
00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.560
planes

51
00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.840
you can see this is a pretty low density

52
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.119
of atoms

53
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.560
they're not even touching in this

54
00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.439
direction it's just like rows

55
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.000
then if i look at the face this is a

56
00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.880
higher

57
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.079
packing density than than this one and

58
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.200
blue

59
00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:12.879
that's our five here on our die

60
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.840
that's our face and then if we go ahead

61
00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.160
and look at that

62
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.840
slice through the body through the

63
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.879
diagonal

64
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.520
cutting off the diagonal corner we now

65
00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.640
have the

66
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.239
closest packed plane with that

67
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.120
nice hexagonal symmetry or

68
00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.239
triangular symmetry depending on how you

69
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.239
describe this

70
00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.080
this looks a lot like the packing of

71
00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.280
billiard balls

72
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.599
right so if you take a look here

73
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.120
these atoms this would be your billiard

74
00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.920
ball rack

75
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.000
so this is the most efficient packing in

76
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.400
two dimensions

77
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.040
all right so what we're going to learn

78
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.280
in the

79
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.400
next time in the next video is how to

80
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.959
describe

81
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.040
each of these different planes we want

82
00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.920
some way of describing them

83
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.400
we're going to use these special indices

84
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.959
and so

85
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.080
we mentioned the one zero zero this is a

86
00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.720
face

87
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.760
the one one zero is cutting off this

88
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.680
edge

89
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.159
and what's called a one one one is

90
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.640
cutting off a corner

91
00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.560
but we'll get to that okay

92
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.800
and this demo also allows us to take a

93
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.200
look at the body centered cubic

94
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.599
you can see that the packing on those

95
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.519
planes are completely different

96
00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.239
than what we had on the face centered

97
00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.879
everything is much more open

98
00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:40.159
and now this blue one this one one zero

99
00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.920
now looks like the best packing in 2d in

100
00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.239
fact this is the highest packing in the

101
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.080
body centered system

102
00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.840
right in the face centered it was the

103
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.799
red plane

104
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.480
one one one that had the highest packing

105
00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.760
so we'll come back to this a few times

106
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.760
as we go through

107
00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:01.840
the course so let's go ahead and go back

108
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.840
to our slideshow

109
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.439
this slide here is just showing what i

110
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.799
just showed you in the mathematica demo

111
00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.159
so i'm going to go ahead and skip this

112
00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.200
one

113
00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.319
and talk about this question of what is

114
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.360
an a b

115
00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:19.199
a b packing versus an abc abc

116
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:23.040
packing so this is where we explain that

117
00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:26.000
so this is a slice across the corner

118
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.160
okay you can see again that triangular

119
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.160
or hexagonal symmetry that's in here

120
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.639
and so this is for the face centered

121
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.759
cubic system

122
00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.440
here so let me go ahead and label that

123
00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.960
and the one over here is going to be for

124
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.560
the hexagonal close pack system

125
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.320
all right let's just go ahead and call

126
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.360
this plane a

127
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.639
okay and this one over here is just a

128
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.800
then we're going to go ahead and build

129
00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.960
another set

130
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.800
take another set of billiard balls put

131
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.080
them in your rack put them on top of the

132
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.199
previous one and they'll

133
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.280
will naturally fall into the

134
00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.400
hollow site in between three atoms below

135
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.320
it okay

136
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.160
forming a little tetrahedron here these

137
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.880
three red ones below and this green one

138
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.560
sitting on top okay so that's my next

139
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.759
set of planes and i can do that over

140
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.400
here as well so everything is identical

141
00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:21.280
then what i've got is my next set i

142
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.360
actually have a choice

143
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.479
i can go ahead and place my next set of

144
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.680
atoms

145
00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:31.919
say in this hollow site

146
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.720
here or i could place it say in this

147
00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.479
hollow site

148
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.560
here okay i can't use both

149
00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.639
because the atoms won't fit i have a

150
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.479
choice of which ones i use

151
00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.960
so this one here would repeat

152
00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.759
the red layer underneath okay now

153
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.759
sitting on top

154
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.520
this site here is unique it doesn't

155
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.600
repeat

156
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.840
the red layer below it or the green

157
00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.360
layer and so this is a third

158
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.759
choice refer to this then as layer c

159
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.039
okay that's what the face centered cubic

160
00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.080
structure does

161
00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:10.080
so this is just saying a plane b plane c

162
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.919
plane and it's arbitrary what we're

163
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.360
calling abc would just mean that there

164
00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.479
are three unique

165
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.080
orientations and then when i continue on

166
00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.800
the next plane that would go on top of

167
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.560
here would then be

168
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:26.240
a again and it repeats this abc

169
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.400
so if you build up your planes this way

170
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.000
then you could rotate it around in space

171
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.199
and you would see that it would create

172
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.440
the face-centered cubic structure

173
00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:37.120
all right over here the hexagonal close

174
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.759
pack what we're going to do is not use

175
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.000
this

176
00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.520
third layer c but we're going to go

177
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.800
ahead and repeat

178
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.840
the first layer the a layer okay the red

179
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.840
ones again

180
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.960
and so this is referred to then as this

181
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.680
a b a b

182
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.360
packing that just continues when i do

183
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.199
that if i was to look in the crystal i

184
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.440
will no longer see this face centered

185
00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.240
structure at all

186
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.199
but instead i will have this hexagonal

187
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.120
packing

188
00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:05.520
okay both these structures have the same

189
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.960
packing density that's 74

190
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.479
the atomic packing factor 0.74

191
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.120
because they're they're made the same

192
00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.400
way okay but they have very different

193
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.800
symmetry

194
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.960
so i want to show you is that this

195
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.199
change in symmetry

196
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.080
okay but again no change in packing

197
00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:24.160
density

198
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.360
results in a very large change in the

199
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.360
mechanical behavior

200
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.599
okay so i'm going to show you the idea

201
00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:34.479
here again that

202
00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:35.039
structure is going to affect in this

203
00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:38.800
case

204
00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:38.800
property or mechanical property

205
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:45.199
so here i've got a material that has the

206
00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:46.160
abc abc packing this is face centered

207
00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:49.919
cubic

208
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:54.000
this is aluminum and over here i've got

209
00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:57.199
zinc which is hcp

210
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.280
following the abab packing

211
00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:01.120
both of these pulled in tension you can

212
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.240
see that the aluminum behaves in a very

213
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.160
ductile way

214
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.280
you can see a lot of change in the

215
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.319
diameter across the sample as it failed

216
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.520
you can see a lot of distortion and what

217
00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:15.520
looks like a cup

218
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:17.120
and a cone okay a lot of duck failure

219
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.199
when you pull on the zinc this is just

220
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.639
showing the bottom half nail of it

221
00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:22.879
you can see what get you get is a

222
00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:25.919
brittle fracture you get a nice

223
00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:26.800
flat cleavage plane across here a little

224
00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:29.599
bit of ductile

225
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.360
tearing at the very end but this is what

226
00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:34.240
is indicative of a brittle fracture

227
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.919
no change in the cross section so again

228
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.320
this is just due to the packing

229
00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.320
difference

230
00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:42.080
now if you're thinking ahead a little

231
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.000
bit you might say well i changed the

232
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.839
structure too

233
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.120
i'm sorry i changed the material right

234
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:48.399
so how do i know this is due to

235
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.800
structure

236
00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:52.640
this difference between face centered

237
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.320
and hexagonal

238
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.080
when in fact i actually went and changed

239
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.959
the material so that's two variables

240
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.120
right

241
00:08:56.959 --> 00:09:00.640
so i'm going to take a look at the case

242
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.680
of tin

243
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.000
on the next slide here tin

244
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.279
has two forms or which are referred to

245
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.880
as allotropes

246
00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:12.160
just meaning it can have two different

247
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.160
structures okay so now in this case

248
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.800
i have the same material but two

249
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.360
different structures

250
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.440
so we have another structure called

251
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.640
tetragonal

252
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.760
which has this stretching of one of the

253
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.600
edge lengths

254
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.440
this is supposed to be a square here it

255
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.120
looks i know rectangular

256
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.000
but it just stretches the one edge

257
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.920
length still 90 degrees

258
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.519
on all the angles this is referred to as

259
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.279
a tetragonal structure you can read

260
00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:42.640
about that in your text

261
00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:44.560
for the other other systems

262
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.320
and it has a atom in the center so it's

263
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.399
called body center it's a body centered

264
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.080
tetragonal this is what's referred to as

265
00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:52.240
white tin

266
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.320
you can see a tensile sample that's been

267
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.519
machined out of white tin

268
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.279
down here we also have

269
00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:00.640
what is called the diamond cubic

270
00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:03.839
structure

271
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.360
so this is a cubic structure so here's a

272
00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:08.959
cube

273
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.399
and it also has atoms in the center of

274
00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:13.279
faces

275
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:15.120
so it's like a face centered cubic

276
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:17.920
except then it also contains

277
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.040
an extra set of four atoms two on the

278
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.240
bottom

279
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.680
and there'll be two up top so again it

280
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.720
looks like face centered with an

281
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.160
additional four

282
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.800
atoms so this would have for example

283
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.399
eight atoms in this unit cell rather

284
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.760
than four

285
00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:35.680
and i know this picture is pretty tough

286
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.880
to see we'll take a look at this

287
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.800
in other ways later and and try and

288
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.480
try and be able to see this in 3d

289
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.680
because this is a really

290
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.560
terrible picture confusing

291
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.839
so if you have trouble seeing this in 3d

292
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.279
don't worry about it yet

293
00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:53.200
hey but this is called diamond cubic

294
00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:54.480
structure right they have different

295
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.760
densities

296
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.519
because of the different packing and you

297
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.120
try to make a tensile sample out of that

298
00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:06.240
and it just crumbles so this structure

299
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.440
is very very brittle this structure is

300
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.920
ductal

301
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.560
so okay so that's just showing you again

302
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.160
the

303
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.959
effect of structure on this case

304
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.279
mechanical

305
00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:18.240
properties so it's pretty interesting

306
00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:20.160
stuff

307
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.680
and as we go on we're going to go ahead

308
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.160
and explain

309
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.279
why this is the case and why does

310
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.600
structure affect

311
00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:29.600
these properties so much
