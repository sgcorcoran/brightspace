115
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
all right for homework you will

116
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.160
be looking at the attractive and

117
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.160
repulsive energies between two ions

118
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.760
this is this example we have potassium

119
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.560
and chloride i don't remember

120
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.160
i thought what your homework was but

121
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.799
they will give you

122
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.080
the attractive equation the repulsive

123
00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:24.239
equation

124
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.000
and remember again what we need is just

125
00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.840
the net so we're just simply going to

126
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.920
plot

127
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.000
simply going to add these two we're

128
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.920
going to do this in a plot

129
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.080
so i'll show you what it looks like in

130
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.360
excel

131
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.280
um and then i'll post maybe a video

132
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.959
helping you actually work through excel

133
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.519
if you're having trouble

134
00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:46.959
but in excel we can go ahead and make a

135
00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.360
column for the attractive

136
00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:51.840
for the repulsive and then add the two

137
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.560
and then plot all of those versus

138
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.600
the radius r and we'll generate this

139
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.360
curve

140
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.600
that we just saw and then from there we

141
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.840
can read off the bond energy

142
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.840
and the equilibrium's atom spacing

143
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.200
okay so again this is going to remind

144
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.920
you of the equation

145
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.840
this is the data that was given and i

146
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.519
have all of that written over here for

147
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.120
my constants

148
00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:20.560
in this case i actually went through and

149
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.360
did the derivative

150
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.239
of the equation and found the equations

151
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.160
for e zero and

152
00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:27.840
r zero so that's what these were for you

153
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.880
don't have to do that

154
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.640
these are calculated

155
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.399
and so what i need to do is just simply

156
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.000
plot this equation so what i'm going to

157
00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.480
do is make a column of

158
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.600
r values and the units are in nanometers

159
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.040
so i'll go ahead and we do that and then

160
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.079
i make a column

161
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.079
for the attractive energy piece

162
00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.760
and a column for the repulsive energy

163
00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.360
piece

164
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.280
and then i'll go ahead and add those two

165
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.799
for the net energy

166
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.480
and then all i need to do is select

167
00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.280
these columns and

168
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.399
tell excel to go ahead and scatter plot

169
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.239
it

170
00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.760
and i'll get something like this here on

171
00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:07.120
the right

172
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.200
i know when you first go ahead and do

173
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.079
this in excel what you'll probably find

174
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.320
is that

175
00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.480
you don't see actually anything except

176
00:01:12.320 --> 00:02:16.959
for maybe a flat line

177
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.720
and then it looks like your curve kind

178
00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.840
of does that

179
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.679
so if you double check on the limits of

180
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.640
the axes here you'll probably find that

181
00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:28.160
they're very very

182
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.959
high so that you can't see as well which

183
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.959
is only

184
00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.560
on the order of in this case say almost

185
00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.679
0.5 i mean

186
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.760
almost negative 5 evs that's because at

187
00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:40.000
very close spacings

188
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.480
the repulsive part is very very large so

189
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.040
you notice the size of these numbers

190
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.320
so what you can do is either skip some

191
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.519
of those when you go ahead and do your

192
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.679
plotting

193
00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.040
or easier is just go ahead and double

194
00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:53.440
click on your y-axis

195
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.959
and change the scale to something much

196
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.280
more reasonable and you'll get your

197
00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.280
curve
