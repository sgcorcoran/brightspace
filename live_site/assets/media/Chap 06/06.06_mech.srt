1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,439
recall that we talked about linear

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,520
elastic behavior before and we've talked

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,440
about hooke's law

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:13,200
the elastic modulus or young's modulus

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,599
and our definitions of stress and strain

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,119
so what we want to do today is to keep

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,840
going beyond this

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,560
region here which we get elastic

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,400
behavior

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,080
let's keep moving along and see what

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,800
happens as we get to higher and higher

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,800
stress values

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,880
all right so as we keep going at some

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,280
point we're going to get to what's

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,600
called the proportional limit

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,719
and this is the limit at which we no

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,920
longer have this

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,760
linear region where we define again as

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,879
the elastic modulus

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,320
but in fact we start to form

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,239
permanent or plastic deformation

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,520
so to the left of this point it's all

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,800
elastic

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,879
to the right of this point it's elastic

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,000
plus plastic plastic was elastic so

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,239
we're adding in

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,080
a plastic component but if we were to

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,640
unload in this region we would get back

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,439
the elastic piece for example to stop

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,960
here

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:15,040
and we were to unload this unloading

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,240
would follow the slope of the elastic

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,439
modulus

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,920
but notice we no longer return back to

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,520
zero but in fact we have an offset in

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,759
the string that's our permanent

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,799
deformation our permanent increase in

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,840
length

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:34,240
of our sample so

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,360
we also have this definition of the

41
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,680
healed strength so most of the time

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,439
what's given in problems and is

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,040
tabulated is the yield strength

44
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,759
not the proportional limit okay

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,520
so the yield strength is defined by

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,920
what's called a 0.2 percent

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,520
offset pool so the yield strength when

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,479
people say that they mean

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,360
0.2 offset yield strength okay but no

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,439
one says all of that

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,040
all right so this yield strength is

52
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,040
defined by

53
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,759
on the strain axis moving over to .002

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,680
and strain right point two percent

55
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,150
and at that point we go ahead and we

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,760
draw

57
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,879
[Music]

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,560
a line with the slope of the elastic

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,480
modulus

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,319
and then where that line hits our stress

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,040
strain curve that

62
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,720
is our yield strength value so that's

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
the method that we would use to find

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,440
that

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,959
so why do we use that and not the

66
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,480
proportional limit

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,160
well the problem with the proportional

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,680
limit is that it's difficult to really

69
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,400
define where that is

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,239
so this is very idealized data so it's

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,239
fairly easy to see

72
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,400
if we were to put a nice straight line

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,080
on the initial part we could see

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,599
where it starts to deviate and we could

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,440
define this point

76
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,200
but many times for real data

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
it's very difficult to define exactly

78
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,159
where this proportional limit is

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,120
okay so the point two percent works very

80
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,519
well

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,560
um in particular this is this is really

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,560
true for the the metals and alloys

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,319
we'll talk about the polymers when we

84
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,640
get to that chapter

85
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,560
and the ceramics will see that they

86
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,800
don't have

87
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,000
yield points they just fracture before

88
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,360
they

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
would actually ever get the plastic

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,680
deformation

91
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,360
okay so we use this method this point

92
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,959
two percent and although it makes it

93
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,760
look like there's quite a difference

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,480
between the

95
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,120
the proportional limit and the yield

96
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,120
strength

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,440
in reality there is not a big difference

98
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,200
between these two points

99
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,360
this curve is just really exaggerated

100
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,519
for the sake of defining

101
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,680
these two values so again this is the

102
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,599
one that we are going to stick with

103
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,640
the yield strings in some text this is

104
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:53,200
given sigma 0 sub 0

105
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:56,560
as the symbol instead of sigma sub y

106
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,920
our text it uses sigma sub y

107
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,280
but if you're looking at a mechanical

108
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:05,120
text you may see sigma zero

109
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,000
written instead okay all right

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,680
there are some uh stress strain curves

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,519
uh particularly in

112
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,200
or the plain carbon steels i should say

113
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,239
mainly just higher than carbon and

114
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,400
no additional elements

115
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,400
where the curve may actually continue on

116
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,720
up to some particular point so this is

117
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,240
all

118
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,880
elastic and then when the curve

119
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,639
deviates from this the stress actually

120
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,479
drops

121
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,240
and then we get this what's called

122
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,120
serrated yielding

123
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,120
and then the curve would then start

124
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,400
continuing on

125
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,759
um and behaving like like the rest of

126
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,160
most samples we'll take a look at that

127
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,400
apart in a minute

128
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,639
and if we do this point two percent

129
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,160
offset yield strength we'll see the draw

130
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,919
put us

131
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,040
in this lower yield point region

132
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,400
so this upper yield point is similar to

133
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,360
uh stick slip type friction cases

134
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,000
so the upper is kind of the stick and

135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,120
then once

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,400
you finally surpass that your

137
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,240
sample will continue on your to move

138
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,759
say in the dynamic friction case

139
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,360
or in this case we're starting to move

140
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,560
dislocations

141
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,520
and once we get them moving

142
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,080
they move at a lower stress value so the

143
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,000
lower yield

144
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,240
point is the is the design point here

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
not the upper

146
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,080
all right so let's keep going beyond

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,280
that region so again here's the elastic

148
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,840
region

149
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,880
so somewhere and here's a proportional

150
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,240
limit um

151
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,479
if we do our offset yield strength

152
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,680
we will probably end up pretty much the

153
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,440
same place

154
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,360
on this scale of the curve for the yield

155
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,520
strength itself

156
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,360
we can keep going eventually we're going

157
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,320
to get to a maximum value this is

158
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,080
referred to as the

159
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,759
tensile strength or the ultimate

160
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,080
strength

161
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,479
sigma ultimate that's typically in

162
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,400
mechanics books

163
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,240
tensile strength is usually used in

164
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,919
materials books

165
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,800
and at that point the curve will start

166
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:14,639
to fall off and then eventually

167
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,560
we get fracture all right so

168
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,440
what's happening at the maximum here is

169
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,240
that this is the point at which the

170
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,960
diameter of the sample undergoes an

171
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,919
instability and starts to neck

172
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,120
and once it starts to neck and shrink in

173
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,680
this one location

174
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,759
then all of the strain the plastic

175
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,800
deformation gets confined in that region

176
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,880
and then

177
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:42,319
we eventually have a failure

178
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,319
i'll post this video in

179
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,400
in canvas for you and we can see this

180
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,479
copper rod being pulled

181
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,160
and then as it's going you'll see that

182
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,680
it next down and then eventually fails

183
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,120
hopefully you also saw that when you

184
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,720
watch the tensile video for the

185
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,400
stainless steel sample you saw that

186
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,639
necking behavior

187
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,639
and then eventually the failure

188
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,840
if we take a look at samples that have

189
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,800
failed in a tension test

190
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,680
you can see two main kinds of behaviors

191
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,919
here

192
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:23,120
one is where the cross-sectional area

193
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:26,639
the diameter here you can clearly see

194
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,479
has decreased right

195
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,960
and another case where it looks like

196
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,199
there's no change and we just have

197
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,759
a flat fracture this one that's

198
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,479
decreased also seems to have this

199
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,039
shear lip on it this kind of looks like

200
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,560
a cup

201
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,080
there's kind of the bottom of the cup in

202
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,520
the sheer lip and

203
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,120
this one is more like a cone it's a cup

204
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,599
and cone fracture

205
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,479
okay this is a shear fracture this is a

206
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,479
brittle fracture

207
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,000
shear fracture and a brittle fracture

208
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,960
so the ductal sample will have a lot of

209
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,240
change

210
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,960
in this cross-sectional area um go ahead

211
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,360
and take a look

212
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,080
at the full curve again and we'll just

213
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,000
point out

214
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,440
a couple of properties that we can get

215
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,720
off of this

216
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,080
so again this initial region we have the

217
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,240
full set of data we're going to have to

218
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,840
do is re-plot it

219
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,360
and we're going to need to replot that

220
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,000
so that we can actually measure

221
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,240
the slope here in this initial region

222
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,160
okay to get the elastic modulus that's

223
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
shown here

224
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,800
we're going to need to be able to see

225
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,200
this .002

226
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,880
to do our offset remember this is the

227
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,599
same slope

228
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,800
and then where it hits our curve that is

229
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,200
our yield strength

230
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,120
then we use the full curve to define the

231
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,800
tensile strength or ultimate strength of

232
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,160
the sample

233
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,519
and ultimately the strain

234
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,440
at fracture so this could be related to

235
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,880
the ductility the sample the percent

236
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,080
elongation

237
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,080
at fracture in this case being 37

238
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,760
all right this is says referred to here

239
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,800
as fake data this

240
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,680
means idealized schematic data i'm going

241
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,240
to show you a real

242
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,240
data in a next video

243
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,959
so again summary we can get the elastic

244
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,800
modulus

245
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,200
from that linear region we can get

246
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,519
the strength and there's two types

247
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,360
there's the yield strength

248
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,839
and then there's the ultimate strength

249
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,600
or tensile strength

250
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,440
okay so when one says the strength of

251
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,800
the sample you can already see

252
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,399
that you have to be careful because

253
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,760
there's two different types right the

254
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,160
yield strength here

255
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,519
defining when we go plastic and then

256
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,440
tensile strength

257
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,760
being that ultimate load the sample can

258
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,360
withstand before it starts necking and

259
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,680
final failure

260
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,360
the ductility can be defined in terms of

261
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,480
that percent elongation

262
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,920
at failure so we just saw a case for 37

263
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,839
percent

264
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,440
the ductility could also be measured in

265
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,399
terms of a percent

266
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,519
reduction in area okay so how much did

267
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,200
the sample change

268
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,200
in cross-sectional area

269
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,560
so that's a measure of ductility so we

270
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,240
can actually put some numbers to

271
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,920
ductility now

272
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,120
instead of just referring to a sample as

273
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,360
being a ductal or not

274
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,440
if we take a look at the material

275
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,040
properties

276
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,560
so we have here structure insensitive

277
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,120
properties

278
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,880
this is the elastic modulus the density

279
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,760
of the sample

280
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,360
melting point so these things are are

281
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,680
all material properties and they're

282
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,360
relatively insensitive to any kind of

283
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,480
structural changes

284
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,880
so it doesn't matter how many

285
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,480
dislocations i have in my sample

286
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,600
for for example my elastic

287
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,680
properties will not change

288
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:03,360
so the yield strength

289
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,720
the tensile strength and things like

290
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,600
ductility these will

291
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,000
all change with the number of

292
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,560
dislocations in my sample

293
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,880
maybe the size of grains in my sample so

294
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,880
those would be structure sensitive

295
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:24,160
properties

296
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,160
there's still material properties
