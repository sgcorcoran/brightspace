1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,080
i just want to say a word about the

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,480
theoretical density so where does this

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,960
theoretical density equation come from

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,280
and how does that compare to

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,160
experimental densities

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,800
so in your text you'll find an equation

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,920
for the

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,920
theoretical density okay where does this

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,279
come from this is really just a unit

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,400
conversion

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,800
so if you think about density which is

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,000
going to be some kind of a quantity

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,520
over a volume okay

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,840
unless we're talking about linear

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,200
densities or planar densities which are

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,760
quantity per length or quantity per area

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,600
here we've got a quantity per volume and

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,760
we normally think of

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,039
something like grams per centimeter

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,879
cubed

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,160
as our density that we could look up in

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,920
the textbook

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,120
but we could also have a density just

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,280
simply the number of atoms

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,199
say per volume that's the density

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,399
quantity right we got a total number of

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,320
atoms per

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,680
per volume so that's really kind of

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,320
where we start

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,600
and so in this equation here n is just

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,320
the number of atoms

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,960
in the unit cell and that takes into

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,640
account 1

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,240
8 for the corners one half for the faces

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,600
and then anything inside of the cell

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,680
would be counted as one

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,680
and so you'll you'll recall hopefully

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,280
that the body centered cubic

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,040
n is equal to two and for the face

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,119
centered cubic if we count those we'll

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,479
get n is equal to four

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,320
okay so that's the number of atoms per

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,040
unit cell and then all we need

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,600
is the volume of the unit cell which we

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,159
know

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,720
in the cubic system then is just that

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,520
edge length lattice parameter a

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,799
cubed so that will give us atoms per

49
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,880
volume

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,159
now if we want to convert that into a

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,880
grams per

52
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,360
centimeter cubed term then what we need

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,320
to do

54
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,880
is take the atomic weight which is

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,840
written in grams per mole

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,759
okay but we know atoms so let's rewrite

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,320
grams per mole

58
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,479
in terms of grams per atom and then we

59
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,920
can just multiply so we'll use

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,640
avogadro's

61
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,280
number of atoms in a mole that converts

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,800
to grams per atom

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,680
so now i know the number of atoms per

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,560
volume i know how many grams per atom

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,720
so if i just go ahead and multiply those

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,239
i'll get my grams per volume

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,239
which is the density that i'm used to

68
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,360
looking up and so that's that's all

69
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,319
the theoretical density is so

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,640
the theoretical density does assume that

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,040
these the crystal structures

72
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,000
that we're using right i'd assume that

73
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,239
we're dealing with

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,400
atoms as spheres uh hard spheres

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,080
and that actually works very well in

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,560
most cases

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,599
but there are times when the atoms don't

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,319
behave exactly like hard spheres

79
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,840
and in the hcp system the hexagonal

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,319
close pack system

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,720
we often will see that that the

82
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,760
the stretch in the c direction many

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,920
times is not

84
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,200
as large as it should be well

85
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,000
theoretically

86
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,959
experimentally it's smaller and that's

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,040
because in that c

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,239
direction instead of the atoms acting as

89
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,400
spheres

90
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,840
they get squashed so they're more like

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,480
ellipsoids

92
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,519
and so that c dimension is a little bit

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,159
smaller

94
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,519
than what is expected theoretically and

95
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,480
so the densities then

96
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,080
therefore be greater experimentally in

97
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,760
some of those cases it's not hugely

98
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,400
greater just a small

99
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,159
a small change but you will see that and

100
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,959
i think you have a

101
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,440
question perhaps in your homework on

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,599
that

103
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,599
but i know that it's in your reading

104
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,599
okay
