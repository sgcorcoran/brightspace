1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
all right with this video i'd like to go

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,400
ahead and just introduce you to the

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,440
discipline

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,200
of material science and engineering so

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,280
we'll just start off with the definition

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,759
the goal of materials science and

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,960
engineering this enabled scientist and

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,240
engineer

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,279
to design select and use materials

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,519
for specific applications and to develop

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,519
new materials for future applications

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,040
all right a good overview of some

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,880
materials research that's going on and

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,880
just to give you a flavor

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,160
the kinds of things that materials

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,960
science

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,239
departments do i just point you to this

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,000
nova site

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,920
they've got a great series called making

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,879
stuff and it goes through a lot of

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,559
interesting

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,559
projects so i'll just leave that to you

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,760
i've sent you out a poll and a

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,399
discussion

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,760
assignment on this particular question

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,160
of whether you

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,159
enjoy the plastic bottle the glass

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,840
bottle or the aluminum can for your

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,960
favorite beverage

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,799
and why you chose what you did and we

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,320
will take a look at that in another

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,080
short video

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,960
once i get your results and we'll talk a

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit about the idea of properties

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,520
performance and take a look at some of

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
the responses that

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,880
that you all make

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
right in material science and

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,560
engineering we'd like to talk about this

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,079
materials tetrahedron and it kind of

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,320
shows the

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,200
core of what we teach and how we

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,040
approach

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,600
engineering so the main idea is that

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,840
material science and engineers are

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,119
interested not only in the

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,759
properties or performance of a material

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,600
but we're very interested in how the

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,600
structure of a material can affect the

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,040
properties

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
and in ways by which we can process the

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,159
material in order to affect the

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,799
structure

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,719
and so when we know these linkages then

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,039
we're able to tailor

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,720
properties and to tailor a material for

57
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,840
a given performance

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,680
by undergoing a processing method

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,599
that alters the structure that gives us

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
the properties that we want

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,680
a combination of properties that results

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,280
in the performance

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,280
also talk about the characterization

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,200
methods we will use those in order to

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,000
measure for example structure

66
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,560
or to measure properties so maybe the

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,760
elastic modulus for example an attention

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,200
test

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,959
we like to think of things in terms of

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,280
this tetrahedron

71
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,480
and we will spend a lot of time in this

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
class

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,480
up front we'll be talking about

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,400
structure and then we'll be talking a

75
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,599
lot about properties

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,440
and their measurements or

77
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,800
characterization especially as

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,959
we move into chapter six and we get into

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
mechanical behavior

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:05,200
and then in the later chapters we will

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:07,920
touch more on the processing methods

82
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,239
okay just as one uh very quick example

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,360
of

84
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,959
optical properties this is a

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,680
this is a aluminum sorry alumina

86
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,080
right aluminum oxide and we have it in

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,000
several

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,480
forms we have this here as a single

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,480
crystal

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,159
we have it in a poly crystal

91
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,840
oops poly crystal and we have one that

92
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,519
is both polycrystalline

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,120
and porous

94
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,280
and we'll learn about what a single

95
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,519
crystal is in a poly crystal

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,000
as we move on through the course but

97
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,480
these are different

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,200
microstructures in the material and

99
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,920
the resultant is in the property of

100
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,720
optical

101
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,799
you have either transparent translucent

102
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,680
or opaque

103
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,319
and so the most expensive one is the

104
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,480
first one

105
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,239
single crystal but that doesn't mean

106
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,840
that the other two

107
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,319
are defective materials that are

108
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,799
not useful in fact they're very useful

109
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,400
for certain applications

110
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,239
so the more porosity we have in

111
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,880
something we lower the density

112
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,000
we also improve the thermal insulation

113
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,400
capabilities

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,040
for example

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,759
so when we say structure of a material

116
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,800
we could mean

117
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,240
many different levels at the very basic

118
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,280
level which is what we'll touch on

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,639
first is the atomic structure

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,560
by atomic structure what we're

121
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,000
interested in is the

122
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,800
bonding between atoms and so you'll read

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,639
about that

124
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,160
in chapter two and then we move up from

125
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,880
there and we start looking at the

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,479
arrangement

127
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,320
of the atoms into a crystal

128
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,800
and this is the atomic arrangement level

129
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,280
we'll do that chapter three

130
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,120
and then microstructure we'll talk a lot

131
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,240
about through most of the chapters in

132
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,000
the text

133
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,080
there we're talking about

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,520
polycrystalline samples

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,840
how the grains are arranged or we'll see

136
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,759
later in chapter 9 we'll talk about

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
different phases of compositions

138
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,960
throughout a material

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,600
the macrostructure will leave out

140
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,520
really of this course mostly we may

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,520
touch on this idea of sharp corners

142
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,759
but we want to hold up the macro

143
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,759
structure

144
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,039
so what do we mean by a material

145
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,120
property

146
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,080
right so material property needs to be

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,280
independent

148
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,800
of the size and shape of the material so

149
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,800
the idea is that we want it to depend on

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:52,080
the material itself

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:54,000
not on its geometry so for example um if

152
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,720
we were simply apply a stimulus to a

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,639
material

154
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,960
so for example maybe a force or stress

155
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,720
and we will see the material response by

156
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,680
deforming

157
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,000
our strain the property that relates the

158
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,680
two

159
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,720
experimentally will be the stiffness

160
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,880
and in terms of the stress strain we're

161
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,960
talking about the elastic modulus or

162
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,120
young's modulus

163
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,400
if you've heard of that especially if

164
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,039
you're from mechanical engineering

165
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,560
you've probably heard of this

166
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,520
we could talk about maybe putting a

167
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,520
temperature change on a sample

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,720
right but the temperature difference say

169
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,639
on a bridge

170
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,919
and you will notice that the expansion

171
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,240
joints in the bridge will either

172
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,479
close or open depending upon whether

173
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,080
it's cold or hot

174
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,000
it's really i should have said it the

175
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,840
other way they close when it's hot they

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,160
open when it's cold

177
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,160
but that temperature change results in

178
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,400
also a deformation of the sample a

179
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,520
change in length

180
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,400
for example which is a strain

181
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:03,840
and the thermal expansion coefficient

182
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,840
relates the two
