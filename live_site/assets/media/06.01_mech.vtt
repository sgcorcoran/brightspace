00:00:00.945 --> 00:00:03.217
Alright, just a reminder that at the

00:00:03.217 --> 00:00:05.814
beginning of Chapter 6 you will find the

00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:08.086
learning objectives and we will take a

00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:10.033
look at all these learning objectives

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.656
throughout this chapter. The exception

00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:14.252
being true stress and true strain that is

00:00:14.252 --> 00:00:17.174
a little bit later in the chapter. So you

00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:19.445
don't have to worry about this learning.

00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:21.719
Objective. We are going to be sticking

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:23.286
with engineering stress and engineering

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:25.792
strain, which I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:26.106
define.

00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:31.521
All right. So we could talk about

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:34.453
attention test or we could talk about a

00:00:34.453 --> 00:00:37.018
compression test, just the reverse of the

00:00:37.018 --> 00:00:39.583
applied force to an attention test. We're

00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:41.782
we're pulling on the sample, we're

00:00:41.782 --> 00:00:43.981
stretching the sample and changing its

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:46.180
length, increasing its length and we

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.724
would get some change. The length delta

00:00:48.724 --> 00:00:51.413
L, if we take a look at the

00:00:51.413 --> 00:00:53.765
length minus the original length and if

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:56.454
we were to go and take that that

00:00:56.454 --> 00:00:59.142
delta L and divide it by this original

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:01.495
length, then we would have the definition

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.511
here of strain. OK, so it's

00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:05.527
dimensionless. It's a length over length

00:01:05.527 --> 00:01:07.880
for compression. It would be exactly the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.370
same. Thing except delta L would end up

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.050
as a negative number and we would have a

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.836
negative strain value. The stress is

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:16.920
defined as negative when when it's in

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.408
compression. That's just that's a

00:01:18.408 --> 00:01:18.706
convention.

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:24.051
And the stress is defined

00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:26.636
as that applied force divided

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:29.221
by the initial cross-sectional area

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:31.805
and that would be in

00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:33.356
units of pascals.

00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:39.446
Shear stress and shear strain are defined

00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:42.223
as the distortion in the sample. So if we

00:01:42.223 --> 00:01:44.691
have a cubic block, say for example, and

00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:47.468
we were to apply a shear stress to the

00:01:47.468 --> 00:01:49.936
surface, this is kind of like having a

00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:52.404
deck of cards and pulling on the bottom

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:55.181
of the deck and pushing on the top of

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.883
the deck you. Way to shear and

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:00.870
it distorts the shape of the original

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.857
deck. And so we would define that

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:06.843
distortion, that delta L for the change

00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:09.830
in length as defined in this figure

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.817
over the original length as our shear

00:02:12.817 --> 00:02:15.804
strain. OK, that's also the tangent of

00:02:15.804 --> 00:02:17.757
the angle. Of distortion.

00:02:19.517 --> 00:02:21.967
The shear stress is also defined as the

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:24.110
force divided by that original area. It's

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.560
just now that that area is now parallel.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.009
So in the deck of cards example, the

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.765
force is applied to the face of that top

00:02:31.765 --> 00:02:34.215
card and bottom card. That would be your

00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:34.827
original area.
