WEBVTT

117
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.801
so this is a slice across the corner

118
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:10.961
okay you can see again that triangular

119
00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:10.961
or hexagonal symmetry that's in here

120
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:15.440
and so this is for the face centered

121
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:18.560
cubic system

122
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.241
here so let me go ahead and label that

123
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.761
and the one over here is going to be for

124
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:25.361
the hexagonal close pack system

125
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:27.121
all right let's just go ahead and call

126
00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:30.161
this plane a

127
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:31.440
okay and this one over here is just a

128
00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:33.601
then we're going to go ahead and build

129
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.761
another set

130
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.601
take another set of billiard balls put

131
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:38.881
them in your rack put them on top of the

132
00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:42.000
previous one and they'll

133
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:44.081
will naturally fall into the

134
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.201
hollow site in between three atoms below

135
00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:47.121
it okay

136
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:48.961
forming a little tetrahedron here these

137
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:51.681
three red ones below and this green one

138
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:53.361
sitting on top okay so that's my next

139
00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:56.560
set of planes and i can do that over

140
00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:59.201
here as well so everything is identical

141
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.081
then what i've got is my next set i

142
00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:04.161
actually have a choice

143
00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:05.280
i can go ahead and place my next set of

144
00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:08.481
atoms

145
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.720
say in this hollow site

146
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:13.521
here or i could place it say in this

147
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.280
hollow site

148
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:19.361
here okay i can't use both

149
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.440
because the atoms won't fit i have a

150
00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:25.280
choice of which ones i use

151
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.761
so this one here would repeat

152
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.560
the red layer underneath okay now

153
00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:30.560
sitting on top

154
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:34.321
this site here is unique it doesn't

155
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:36.401
repeat

156
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:38.641
the red layer below it or the green

157
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:42.161
layer and so this is a third

158
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:44.560
choice refer to this then as layer c

159
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:45.840
okay that's what the face centered cubic

160
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.881
structure does

161
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.881
so this is just saying a plane b plane c

162
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:52.720
plane and it's arbitrary what we're

163
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:54.161
calling abc would just mean that there

164
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.280
are three unique

165
00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:58.881
orientations and then when i continue on

166
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.601
the next plane that would go on top of

167
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:03.361
here would then be

168
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:07.041
a again and it repeats this abc

169
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:09.201
so if you build up your planes this way

170
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:10.801
then you could rotate it around in space

171
00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:14.000
and you would see that it would create

172
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:16.241
the face-centered cubic structure

173
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.921
all right over here the hexagonal close

174
00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:18.560
pack what we're going to do is not use

175
00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:20.801
this

176
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.321
third layer c but we're going to go

177
00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:25.601
ahead and repeat

178
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:26.641
the first layer the a layer okay the red

179
00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:28.641
ones again

180
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:29.761
and so this is referred to then as this

181
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:32.481
a b a b

182
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:34.161
packing that just continues when i do

183
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:36.000
that if i was to look in the crystal i

184
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:38.241
will no longer see this face centered

185
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.041
structure at all

186
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:42.000
but instead i will have this hexagonal

187
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:43.921
packing

188
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.321
okay both these structures have the same

189
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:49.761
packing density that's 74

190
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:51.280
the atomic packing factor 0.74

191
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:53.921
because they're they're made the same

192
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.201
way okay but they have very different

193
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:57.601
symmetry

194
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:59.761
so i want to show you is that this

195
00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:02.000
change in symmetry

196
00:02:59.761 --> 00:03:02.881
okay but again no change in packing

197
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.961
density

198
00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:08.161
results in a very large change in the

199
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.161
mechanical behavior

200
00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:12.400
okay so i'm going to show you the idea

201
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.280
here again that

202
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.840
structure is going to affect in this

203
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.601
case

204
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.601
property or mechanical property

205
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:26.000
so here i've got a material that has the

206
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.960
abc abc packing this is face centered

207
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.720
cubic

208
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.801
this is aluminum and over here i've got

209
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.000
zinc which is hcp

210
00:03:34.801 --> 00:03:40.081
following the abab packing

211
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.921
both of these pulled in tension you can

212
00:03:40.081 --> 00:03:43.041
see that the aluminum behaves in a very

213
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.961
ductile way

214
00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:48.081
you can see a lot of change in the

215
00:03:44.961 --> 00:03:51.120
diameter across the sample as it failed

216
00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:52.321
you can see a lot of distortion and what

217
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.321
looks like a cup

218
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:57.921
and a cone okay a lot of duck failure

219
00:03:56.321 --> 00:04:00.000
when you pull on the zinc this is just

220
00:03:57.921 --> 00:04:01.440
showing the bottom half nail of it

221
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.680
you can see what get you get is a

222
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.720
brittle fracture you get a nice

223
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.601
flat cleavage plane across here a little

224
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.400
bit of ductile

225
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:12.161
tearing at the very end but this is what

226
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.041
is indicative of a brittle fracture

227
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:16.720
no change in the cross section so again

228
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:19.121
this is just due to the packing

229
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.121
difference

230
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.881
now if you're thinking ahead a little

231
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:24.801
bit you might say well i changed the

232
00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:26.640
structure too

233
00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:27.921
i'm sorry i changed the material right

234
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.200
so how do i know this is due to

235
00:04:27.921 --> 00:04:31.601
structure

236
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.441
this difference between face centered

237
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:35.121
and hexagonal

238
00:04:33.441 --> 00:04:36.881
when in fact i actually went and changed

239
00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:37.760
the material so that's two variables

240
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:39.921
right

241
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.441
so i'm going to take a look at the case

242
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:44.481
of tin

243
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:46.801
on the next slide here tin

244
00:04:44.481 --> 00:04:48.080
has two forms or which are referred to

245
00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:49.681
as allotropes

246
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.961
just meaning it can have two different

247
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:54.961
structures okay so now in this case

248
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:57.601
i have the same material but two

249
00:04:54.961 --> 00:05:00.161
different structures

250
00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:02.241
so we have another structure called

251
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:05.441
tetragonal

252
00:05:02.241 --> 00:05:06.561
which has this stretching of one of the

253
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:08.401
edge lengths

254
00:05:06.561 --> 00:05:10.241
this is supposed to be a square here it

255
00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:11.921
looks i know rectangular

256
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:14.801
but it just stretches the one edge

257
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:16.721
length still 90 degrees

258
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:18.320
on all the angles this is referred to as

259
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:20.080
a tetragonal structure you can read

260
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.441
about that in your text

261
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.361
for the other other systems

262
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:27.121
and it has a atom in the center so it's

263
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:29.200
called body center it's a body centered

264
00:05:27.121 --> 00:05:30.881
tetragonal this is what's referred to as

265
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.041
white tin

266
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:35.121
you can see a tensile sample that's been

267
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:38.320
machined out of white tin

268
00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:40.080
down here we also have

269
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.441
what is called the diamond cubic

270
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.640
structure

271
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:46.161
so this is a cubic structure so here's a

272
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.760
cube

273
00:05:46.161 --> 00:05:51.200
and it also has atoms in the center of

274
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.080
faces

275
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.921
so it's like a face centered cubic

276
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.721
except then it also contains

277
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:59.841
an extra set of four atoms two on the

278
00:05:58.721 --> 00:06:03.041
bottom

279
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:04.481
and there'll be two up top so again it

280
00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:05.521
looks like face centered with an

281
00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:08.961
additional four

282
00:06:05.521 --> 00:06:11.601
atoms so this would have for example

283
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:13.200
eight atoms in this unit cell rather

284
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:14.561
than four

285
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.481
and i know this picture is pretty tough

286
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:19.681
to see we'll take a look at this

287
00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:21.601
in other ways later and and try and

288
00:06:19.681 --> 00:06:23.281
try and be able to see this in 3d

289
00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:26.481
because this is a really

290
00:06:23.281 --> 00:06:29.361
terrible picture confusing

291
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:30.640
so if you have trouble seeing this in 3d

292
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:32.080
don't worry about it yet

293
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.001
hey but this is called diamond cubic

294
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.281
structure right they have different

295
00:06:34.001 --> 00:06:38.561
densities

296
00:06:35.281 --> 00:06:40.320
because of the different packing and you

297
00:06:38.561 --> 00:06:43.921
try to make a tensile sample out of that

298
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:47.041
and it just crumbles so this structure

299
00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:48.241
is very very brittle this structure is

300
00:06:47.041 --> 00:06:50.721
ductal

301
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:51.361
so okay so that's just showing you again

302
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:54.961
the

303
00:06:51.361 --> 00:06:55.760
effect of structure on this case

304
00:06:54.961 --> 00:06:58.080
mechanical

305
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.041
properties so it's pretty interesting

306
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.961
stuff

307
00:06:59.041 --> 00:07:02.481
and as we go on we're going to go ahead

308
00:07:00.961 --> 00:07:04.961
and explain

309
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:06.080
why this is the case and why does

310
00:07:04.961 --> 00:07:10.401
structure affect

311
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.401
these properties so much
