00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.727
Chapter 3 Structure of crystalline solids

00:00:02.727 --> 00:00:05.523
So today we're going to take a look

00:00:05.523 --> 00:00:08.319
at the structure. Last time we took a

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:10.416
look at the atomic structure. Otherwise

00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:12.512
the bonding between atoms. We talked

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:14.609
about primary bond types. Hopefully you

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.405
can name 3 and we talked about secondary

00:00:17.405 --> 00:00:19.852
bond types. Today we're going to talk

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:22.428
about the. Atomic arrangement of atoms,

00:00:22.428 --> 00:00:25.094
how do the atoms pack to

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:27.760
form a crystal structure? And the

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.982
reason we're interested in structures,

00:00:29.982 --> 00:00:31.759
that structure directly affects

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.981
properties. And then ultimately we're

00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:36.647
going to see as we move

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:39.314
through the course many different ways

00:00:39.314 --> 00:00:41.091
of processing a material.

00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:44.821
In the processing ultimately will affect

00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:46.774
structure, so ultimately affect

00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:49.216
properties O Understanding the structure

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:51.658
property relationship and how processing

00:00:51.658 --> 00:00:54.588
effects structure would help us tailor

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.541
materials for specific uses.

00:00:58.631 --> 00:01:01.319
So you can you can grow your own crystal

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.708
structures if you want. Alum is a good

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:06.097
system to grow crops are very nice big

00:01:06.097 --> 00:01:07.889
crystals and these are analog. That's

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:10.278
just the spice in your grocery store. One

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.966
of the things you notice when you grow a

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.355
single crystal and say this piece here is

00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:17.147
a single crystal, right? Here's another

00:01:17.147 --> 00:01:19.794
one each of these. See single crystal. So

00:01:19.794 --> 00:01:22.194
all the atoms in these different pieces

00:01:22.194 --> 00:01:24.595
have the same structure, and they're all

00:01:24.595 --> 00:01:27.338
oriented the same way. One of the things

00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:29.739
you'll notice is that they're angles here

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:32.482
will show up and repeat in the different

00:01:32.482 --> 00:01:34.883
structures, so the lengths of edges might

00:01:34.883 --> 00:01:37.284
change in length, but the angles are

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:40.026
always the same. So that implies there's

00:01:40.026 --> 00:01:42.569
some order to the arrangement of the

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.932
atoms.
