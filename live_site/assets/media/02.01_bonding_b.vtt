115
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.720
all right for homework you will

116
00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.400
be looking at the attractive and

117
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.400
repulsive energies between two ions

118
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.000
this is this example we have potassium

119
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.800
and chloride i don't remember

120
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.400
i thought what your homework was but

121
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.039
they will give you

122
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.320
the attractive equation the repulsive

123
00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.479
equation

124
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.240
and remember again what we need is just

125
00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.080
the net so we're just simply going to

126
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.160
plot

127
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.240
simply going to add these two we're

128
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.160
going to do this in a plot

129
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.320
so i'll show you what it looks like in

130
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.600
excel

131
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.520
um and then i'll post maybe a video

132
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.199
helping you actually work through excel

133
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.759
if you're having trouble

134
00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.199
but in excel we can go ahead and make a

135
00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.600
column for the attractive

136
00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.080
for the repulsive and then add the two

137
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.800
and then plot all of those versus

138
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.840
the radius r and we'll generate this

139
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.600
curve

140
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.840
that we just saw and then from there we

141
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.080
can read off the bond energy

142
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.080
and the equilibrium's atom spacing

143
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.440
okay so again this is going to remind

144
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.160
you of the equation

145
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.080
this is the data that was given and i

146
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.759
have all of that written over here for

147
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.360
my constants

148
00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.800
in this case i actually went through and

149
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.600
did the derivative

150
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.479
of the equation and found the equations

151
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.400
for e zero and

152
00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.080
r zero so that's what these were for you

153
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.120
don't have to do that

154
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.880
these are calculated

155
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.639
and so what i need to do is just simply

156
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.240
plot this equation so what i'm going to

157
00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:30.720
do is make a column of

158
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.840
r values and the units are in nanometers

159
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.280
so i'll go ahead and we do that and then

160
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.319
i make a column

161
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.319
for the attractive energy piece

162
00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.000
and a column for the repulsive energy

163
00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:43.600
piece

164
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.520
and then i'll go ahead and add those two

165
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.039
for the net energy

166
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.720
and then all i need to do is select

167
00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.520
these columns and

168
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.639
tell excel to go ahead and scatter plot

169
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.479
it

170
00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.000
and i'll get something like this here on

171
00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.360
the right

172
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.440
i know when you first go ahead and do

173
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.319
this in excel what you'll probably find

174
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.560
is that

175
00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:04.720
you don't see actually anything except

176
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.199
for maybe a flat line

177
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.960
and then it looks like your curve kind

178
00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:12.080
of does that

179
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.919
so if you double check on the limits of

180
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.880
the axes here you'll probably find that

181
00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:18.400
they're very very

182
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.199
high so that you can't see as well which

183
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.199
is only

184
00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:22.800
on the order of in this case say almost

185
00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:25.919
0.5 i mean

186
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.000
almost negative 5 evs that's because at

187
00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.240
very close spacings

188
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.720
the repulsive part is very very large so

189
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.280
you notice the size of these numbers

190
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.560
so what you can do is either skip some

191
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.759
of those when you go ahead and do your

192
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.919
plotting

193
00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:41.280
or easier is just go ahead and double

194
00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:43.680
click on your y-axis

195
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.199
and change the scale to something much

196
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.520
more reasonable and you'll get your

197
00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:47.520
curve
