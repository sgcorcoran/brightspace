00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.879
all right in uh chapter three

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.240
we discuss the uh crystalline solids uh

3
00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.440
the regular arrangement

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.639
and packing of atoms into a crystal

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.880
structure

6
00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.720
and when we we spoke of this we didn't

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.119
speak about defects yet

8
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.160
each location within the structure had

9
00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.160
an atom

10
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.400
and this crystalline solid was

11
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.680
considered infinite in size

12
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.680
so we're going to do now is we're going

13
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.800
to go ahead and consider the types of

14
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.279
defects or

15
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.440
or imperfections that would exist in

16
00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.800
crystalline solids

17
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.800
now one of the reasons why we're

18
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.520
interested in this is because the

19
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.480
defects

20
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.480
often dominate the properties of a solid

21
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.680
and equally as important through

22
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.239
processing techniques that we'll see

23
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.120
later

24
00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.879
in this textbook uh processing

25
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.520
techniques can change the number and

26
00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.600
types of defects

27
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.760
and since they can change the change the

28
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.480
number and types of defects

29
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.479
that is their structure these defects

30
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.199
can control our older properties we now

31
00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.000
have a

32
00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.240
direct way through processing to affect

33
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.799
the properties of materials right so

34
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.479
there's

35
00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.560
three sort of classes or levels

36
00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.320
of imperfections that we can talk about

37
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.200
there's the one-dimensional

38
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.360
two-dimensional

39
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.479
three-dimensional in terms of their

40
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.799
extent

41
00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.680
referred to in your text is point

42
00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.200
defects

43
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.680
line defects and interfacial or surface

44
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.240
type

45
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.000
defects okay so we'll go through each of

46
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.680
these types

47
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.360
in order so we'll go ahead and take a

48
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.640
look at the

49
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.840
point defects the vacancy and the

50
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.320
interstitial

51
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.759
will be kind of the two main categories

52
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.960
and then we'll take a look at a few

53
00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.720
others

54
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.280
but here on the left side we've got a

55
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.680
a slice through a crystal structure

56
00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.479
looking at a plane maybe this looks like

57
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.759
the one zero zero for the face centered

58
00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.960
cubic

59
00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.080
so you can see the face

60
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.239
right here for the fcc structure

61
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.120
and now we can see that there's a

62
00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.040
missing atom

63
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.879
so missing atoms are simply referred to

64
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.239
as vacancies

65
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.520
in the structure and we could also have

66
00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.560
the case where maybe an

67
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.280
atom exists where it shouldn't

68
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.160
so it's in between atoms like this one

69
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.120
here

70
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.680
this is referred to as an interstitial

71
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.080
these

72
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.560
sites between the atoms are referred to

73
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.200
as interstitial sites

74
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.680
this one specifically is a

75
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.280
self-interstitial

76
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.040
because it's an atom of the same type

77
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.319
so we could also talk about impurity

78
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.920
interstitials

79
00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.480
which would be an atom of a different

80
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.680
type into this lattice

81
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.160
all right so one thing you can see about

82
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.239
a self interstitial

83
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.760
is that it's not going to fit right so

84
00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.800
the way this is drawn there's

85
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.959
these atoms are all overlapping so this

86
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.480
lattice would have to stretch out and

87
00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.680
distort

88
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.319
in order to fit this atom right in here

89
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.760
in this site so this is not going to be

90
00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.879
as common

91
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.120
as say a vacancy

92
00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.040
the vacancies are one of the defects

93
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.519
that are actually thermodynamically

94
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.440
stable

95
00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.920
so we can't get rid of them in fact

96
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.680
their number

97
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.760
there's an equilibrium number of them

98
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.400
that depends on the temperature

99
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.159
of the solid and as we approach the

100
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.519
melting point

101
00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:39.440
this number of vacancies increases

102
00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.959
exponentially so you'll have a problem

103
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.519
in your homework take a look at the

104
00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.080
number of vacancies in a solid

105
00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.680
i'll just refer you to problem 4.1 in

106
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.319
your textbook which will run through a

107
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.599
simple problem using this equation

108
00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.680
but let's take a look at the equation

109
00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.840
for a second this is called an arrhenius

110
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.959
equation

111
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.000
okay anytime you see an equation of this

112
00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.200
form we've got an

113
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.720
exponential of some kind of an energy

114
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.000
barrier

115
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.640
over kt that's

116
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
thermal energy is boltzmann's constant

117
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.880
and this is the temperature

118
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.160
in kelvin so this is like a probability

119
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.320
that we can overcome this

120
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.800
formation energy or this barrier you've

121
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.960
seen this before in chemical kinetics

122
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.360
where this was the energy for a reaction

123
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.120
to overcome the barrier

124
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.120
okay so this is like a probability that

125
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.240
a given site

126
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.080
could be a vacancy and then this is the

127
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.320
number of sites

128
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.759
that are in our given structure say per

129
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.840
meter cubed

130
00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.040
and then that will give us the number of

131
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.400
vacancies

132
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.400
in that same volume say meter cubed

133
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.479
so many times we'll just move this and

134
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.040
over here and we'll look at simply the

135
00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.240
vacancy fraction so the number of

136
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.280
vacancies

137
00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.320
per atom site in a given material

138
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.320
vacancy fraction

139
00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.000
all right uh let's see what else can we

140
00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.039
say

141
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.840
the um this activation energy q

142
00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.759
we're going to see is on the order of an

143
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.039
electron volt so that's a convenient

144
00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.479
unit to use

145
00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.479
so you're going to need to use

146
00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.320
boltzmann's constant

147
00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.320
also in units of electron volts

148
00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.800
all right point defects in the metal or

149
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.240
alloy

150
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.880
continued here so we've seen the

151
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.880
self-interstitial

152
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.560
and we've seen the vacancy the missing

153
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.320
atom case

154
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.199
we can also talk about these um

155
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.639
defects when we also have alloys so

156
00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.039
let's say we had a

157
00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.880
an alloy here maybe a nickel so we have

158
00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.120
this crystal structure here

159
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.160
uh nickel this is a face centered cubic

160
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.960
material

161
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.240
so this represents maybe one one one

162
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.280
plane

163
00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.720
and then we're substituting in copper

164
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.560
in place of some of the nickel in this

165
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:08.000
lattice okay these atomic sites

166
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.400
so this is a substitutional impurity

167
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.080
okay i'm removing the host atom i'm

168
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.319
substituting in a different type so it's

169
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.880
substitutional impurity

170
00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:21.600
and this alloy is referred to as a

171
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:24.720
substitutional solid solution

172
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.919
now we could also take a

173
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.479
an alloy a smaller atom

174
00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:32.000
into a host and have it locate at

175
00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.600
interstitial sites

176
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.080
as referred to as an interstitial

177
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.199
impurity a good example of this one

178
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.160
would be carbon

179
00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:42.400
in iron forming a steel so we'd have a

180
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.960
steel structure

181
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.319
the iron the host and then the carbon

182
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.120
would sit

183
00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:50.560
in the interstitial sites now in this

184
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.720
picture it makes it look like it sits

185
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.919
perfectly in here in fact the carbon is

186
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.440
a little bit big

187
00:06:53.919 --> 00:07:00.000
and so it does distort the lattice

188
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.520
increases the energy of that system and

189
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.240
so we'll see that we can't put

190
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.680
a whole lot of carbon into the iron

191
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.720
because of this

192
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.919
if you try and push in too much then

193
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:17.840
the carbon will precipitate out

194
00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:17.840
of this lattice and form an iron carbide

195
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.560
all right so what we want to do is to go

196
00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:24.880
ahead and see if we can calculate with

197
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.960
our knowledge of crystal structures

198
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.080
what the size of these interstitial

199
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.360
sites might be

200
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.240
so we're going to take a look at the

201
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.720
types of interstitial sites we have

202
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.120
and then see if we can't calculate their

203
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.120
size

204
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.560
so i'm just going to define two types in

205
00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:43.440
the face-centered cubic structure your

206
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.440
book

207
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.759
will describe for you the body centered

208
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.520
cubic structure

209
00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:52.160
so if we take a look at the face

210
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.080
centered cubic structure so

211
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.840
these atoms here in blue and i've

212
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.319
highlighted a few of them here and

213
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.120
talk about that in a second but the blue

214
00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:01.199
are in

215
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.319
face-centered cubic positions okay you

216
00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:04.400
can see the

217
00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:06.240
centers here faces containing the blue

218
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.080
atoms

219
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.400
and then they've got a couple of other

220
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.039
atoms and purity atoms that are located

221
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.759
in between sites so there's one that's

222
00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:18.000
directly in the middle

223
00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:20.000
and i'll talk about that one in just a

224
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.560
second over here

225
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.800
we've got one sitting on this edge okay

226
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.319
so that represents a type of site

227
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.080
that could be any of the edges and we've

228
00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:31.919
got one that's sitting here

229
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.599
that we've seen before in the diamond

230
00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:35.200
cubic structure in the zinc blend

231
00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:38.320
structure

232
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.479
that's sitting off of this atom by a

233
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.760
quarter quarter quarter in terms of its

234
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:43.680
location

235
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.360
this one is the one that's is in a

236
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.120
tetrahedral site

237
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:53.680
so if i take this corner atom and the

238
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:56.240
three faces they bring faces

239
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.080
we will find that these three form a

240
00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.000
triangle they're all touching

241
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.839
and this one's sitting on top of them

242
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.839
also touching and so here's our picture

243
00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:10.320
so if you want this atom is

244
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.240
this one here this is our little

245
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.720
tetrahedral atom sitting in the

246
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.240
in the middle in this tetrahedral site

247
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.839
and then we've got

248
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:23.920
these other three atoms

249
00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:26.240
forming this base of this pyramid

250
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.279
and so we want to find out what the size

251
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.440
of this

252
00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:31.440
atom is that just fits in this little

253
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.560
tetrahedral site

254
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.440
okay the one in the center if i look

255
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.440
over here

256
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.480
there's a big hole in the face centered

257
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.399
cubic

258
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.120
structure right in the center of the

259
00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:45.440
body you have to position one half one

260
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.880
half one half

261
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:51.920
and the if i take the neighboring six

262
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.720
face atoms those are actually all

263
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.320
touching you can see that down here

264
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.959
and then there's the site right in the

265
00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.160
middle and this is referred to as an

266
00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:01.839
octahedron

267
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.279
i connect all these sides you can see

268
00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:06.000
here this forms

269
00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:08.320
an octahedron so this is an octahedral

270
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.320
site

271
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.920
all right and a similar kind of site

272
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:13.279
here for the edges

273
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.959
if we were to put on the rest of the

274
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.240
blue lattice we'd actually see that this

275
00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:19.360
is similar

276
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:23.120
and again it forms an octahedral

277
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.040
site so for homework

278
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.600
uh you're going to have to work on this

279
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.880
one the octahedral site

280
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.800
i'm going to go ahead and show you how

281
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.839
to do this tetrahedral

282
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:38.320
one so you can use the same method

283
00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:40.320
for the octahedral all right so

284
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.399
we could use a lot of geometry if we

285
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.000
wanted and figure out the size of the

286
00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:45.440
spacing in here

287
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.720
but i'm going to try and show you just a

288
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.959
simpler way just using

289
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.680
distance between points this is

290
00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:55.600
essentially related to a dot product

291
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.800
what i'm going to do is i'm going to go

292
00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.079
ahead

293
00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:03.279
and take this tetrahedral atom

294
00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:03.279
which is located at

295
00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:09.120
one quarter three quarters

296
00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:10.399
one quarter okay you can see that's

297
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.839
given

298
00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:14.079
here in the problem and i need one more

299
00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:16.480
atom

300
00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:18.399
that's touching it so i'm just going to

301
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.040
go ahead and take this

302
00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:22.000
corner one here this is easy for us to

303
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:26.720
get a

304
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.720
coordinate from so that's 0 1

305
00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:33.440
0. all right so let's go ahead

306
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:36.640
and subtract these two

307
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:40.240
so that'll form the

308
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:43.519
vector connecting these two points

309
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.279
so that would be one quarter uh

310
00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:47.440
three quarters minus one is minus

311
00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:50.480
quarter

312
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:53.440
quarter all right

313
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.839
and the magnitude of that so that'll be

314
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.839
now the distance between

315
00:11:55.839 --> 00:12:03.839
the tetrahedral atom and the corner atom

316
00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:06.480
is going to be square root of three

317
00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:06.480
over four

318
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.440
so let me go ahead and we'll grab these

319
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.320
two atoms and see what we just did

320
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.160
so we've got that one i've got this big

321
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.200
one they're touching

322
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.240
this is little r

323
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.639
and the center here is big r

324
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.639
and so

325
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.720
um what i do know is that the distance

326
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.920
between these

327
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.639
now is square root 3

328
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.600
r but i have to remember that i need to

329
00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:43.040
multiply by

330
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:46.399
a because this work up here was done

331
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:48.399
relative to the edge length of our unit

332
00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:49.760
cell this is just fractional

333
00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:51.600
but if i want to actually start putting

334
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.680
the size of atoms

335
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.200
into this structure then i want to use

336
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.920
the real dimension so i'm going to

337
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.680
multiply by

338
00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:02.720
a the length here

339
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:06.000
so i can get real coordinates so what i

340
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.600
have then is little r plus big r here is

341
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.200
equal to the square root of 3

342
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:13.600
over 4 times a

343
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.720
and you'll recall that for the face

344
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.839
centered

345
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:22.720
system i hope that the edge length

346
00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:26.320
a is given by four times

347
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:29.440
the radius of the host here

348
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:32.839
over the square root of two

349
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.160
all right so if we just go ahead and

350
00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:37.440
rearrange

351
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:41.440
i'm going to get r

352
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:44.560
little r over r is equal to

353
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:47.760
the square root of 3 over

354
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:50.000
the square root of 2 minus

355
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.000
1.

356
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:58.160
and put that in my calculator and i get

357
00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.160
0.225

358
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.079
okay so what does that mean so if i have

359
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.360
the radius of my host let's say

360
00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:06.480
that it's iron i can go ahead and put

361
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.800
the

362
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:14.720
radius of iron in here

363
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:18.079
and approximately two tenths

364
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.880
of that iron radius would be the radius

365
00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:22.399
the maximum radius of my interstitial

366
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.839
that would just fit into this

367
00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:27.040
tetrahedral site without needing any

368
00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:29.839
extra room

369
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.240
okay now it's not the maximum size of a

370
00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:34.000
of an

371
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:37.279
interstitial atom that can fit

372
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.040
in in well i say real life

373
00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:41.279
because you can fit bigger ones in there

374
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.600
they'll just distort the lattice

375
00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:45.120
but by distorting the lattice i won't be

376
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.399
able to

377
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.000
put as many into the overall structure

378
00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:51.360
if they are small enough to just fit

379
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.800
inside the interstitials without

380
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:56.000
stretching the lattice

381
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.600
then i can get a lot more of them into

382
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.639
the structure

383
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.040
but this is the size of this hole that

384
00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:03.279
is

385
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.880
in the structure and what you're going

386
00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:06.000
to have for homework to do would be this

387
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.399
one

388
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.079
this is going to be much bigger in size

389
00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:11.600
you'll you'll see

390
00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:14.560
and again you can use the same kind of

391
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:17.600
method you're given the

392
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:21.040
the coordinates for the center atom here

393
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:23.279
and all you need is just one of these

394
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.040
face atoms because they're all touching

395
00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:29.519
and you go through the same

396
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:31.759
type of procedure okay

397
00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:33.120
that's all i have for now we'll continue

398
00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:38.399
on to the

399
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:38.399
