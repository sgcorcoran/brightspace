00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,040
all right welcome to part two
of chapter five diffusion in solids

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,599
we left off last time describing
the vacancy and interstitial mechanism

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,120
for diffusion
those are the mechanisms for how

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,359
diffusion occurs.  This time
we'd like to address why this is an

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,680
important part of processing

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,280
so the book goes through a couple of
examples we're going to just take a look

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,920
at two. 
One of the things that the movement of

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,079
mass or diffusion
in a solid allows us to do is to case

9
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,840
harden the surface
so let's say for example we have a gear

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,480
that's made from
a relatively ductile steel

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,039
so that we don't end up with cracking. 
Ductile materials tend to not be very

12
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,079
good in wear
and so we would like to harden the

13
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,600
surface increase its hardness
which will increase its wear properties

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,000
well if you increase the
carbon concentration in steel

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,760
it increases its hardness so what we
could do here is diffuse

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,280
carbon into the surface of the steel so
that we

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,759
create a case hardened
surface okay so it'll resist

18
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,200
wear but the ductility of the gear
itself

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,360
will resist fracture and failure okay so
this is called

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,960
case hardening this is interstitial
diffusion this particular case

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,079
of carbon in iron
so we will learn how to predict this

22
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:43,840
as we move on all right another case
is in the processing of

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,040
silicon so what we could do with silicon
is

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,520
we could dope phosphorus for n-type
semiconductors

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,360
in a pattern and so the
steps would be to deposit phosphorus

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,200
on the surface in a pattern of interest
heat it up right so the diffusion moves

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
quicker
and the phosphorus would then diffuse

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,120
into the silicon
resulting in a doped n-type

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,360
semiconductor
in some designed pattern

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,400
okay so next time in the next video
we're going to discuss how the rate of

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,720
diffusion can be predicted
for the very simple case of steady state

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,720
diffusion
