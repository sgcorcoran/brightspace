1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.240
so let's take a look at

2
00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.600
the packing in a face-centered cubic

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.960
structure

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.120
so i've got here just kind of a little

5
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.759
demo that i wrote um

6
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.320
showing the face centered structure

7
00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.359
here's

8
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.560
for a single unit cell for example so

9
00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:23.359
you can see the cubic structure

10
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.920
and you can see that in the face of this

11
00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.920
cube

12
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.760
you've got an atom okay so a face

13
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.920
centered cubic structure

14
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.840
so we're going to add on a bunch more

15
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.440
unit cells so we can kind of build up

16
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.719
our crystal

17
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.600
and one of the things i want you to

18
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.360
notice is that depending upon

19
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.320
which direction we look at this crystal

20
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.120
we're going to have a different

21
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.520
placement

22
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.800
of atoms so for example

23
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.600
i just want to highlight the faces

24
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.480
so you can see the faces have this

25
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.559
square

26
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.039
geometry it looks like the 5 on the die

27
00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.920
but if i was to look say along one of

28
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.480
the

29
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.119
diagonals of this structure i'm going to

30
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.600
slice it in a different direction

31
00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.240
you can see now i've got again a nice

32
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.200
plane of atoms

33
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.880
but now they've got a triangular or if

34
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.479
you want to look in here you'll see that

35
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.600
there's a hexagonal

36
00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.920
pattern to the structure okay

37
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.759
so each direction that we were to slice

38
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.080
this material let me slice it yet again

39
00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.080
one more direction

40
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.119
this is now cutting off an edge you can

41
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.119
see that

42
00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.479
edge now also forms a plane when i cut

43
00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.159
that edge off

44
00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.320
and my atoms have again another

45
00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.159
symmetry that you don't see in the

46
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.720
others and different packing

47
00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.560
this is a very low density packing in

48
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.560
fact let me go ahead and remove

49
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.399
the atoms so i can just look at the

50
00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.560
planes

51
00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.840
you can see this is a pretty low density

52
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.119
of atoms

53
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.560
they're not even touching in this

54
00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.439
direction it's just like rows

55
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.000
then if i look at the face this is a

56
00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.880
higher

57
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.079
packing density than than this one and

58
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.200
blue

59
00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:12.879
that's our five here on our die

60
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.840
that's our face and then if we go ahead

61
00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.160
and look at that

62
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.840
slice through the body through the

63
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.879
diagonal

64
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.520
cutting off the diagonal corner we now

65
00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.640
have the

66
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.239
closest packed plane with that

67
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.120
nice hexagonal symmetry or

68
00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.239
triangular symmetry depending on how you

69
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.239
describe this

70
00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.080
this looks a lot like the packing of

71
00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.280
billiard balls

72
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.599
right so if you take a look here

73
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.120
these atoms this would be your billiard

74
00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.920
ball rack

75
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.000
so this is the most efficient packing in

76
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.400
two dimensions

77
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.040
all right so what we're going to learn

78
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.280
in the

79
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.400
next time in the next video is how to

80
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.959
describe

81
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.040
each of these different planes we want

82
00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.920
some way of describing them

83
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.400
we're going to use these special indices

84
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.959
and so

85
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.080
we mentioned the one zero zero this is a

86
00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.720
face

87
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.760
the one one zero is cutting off this

88
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.680
edge

89
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.159
and what's called a one one one is

90
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.640
cutting off a corner

91
00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.560
but we'll get to that okay

92
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.800
and this demo also allows us to take a

93
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.200
look at the body centered cubic

94
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.599
you can see that the packing on those

95
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.519
planes are completely different

96
00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.239
than what we had on the face centered

97
00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.879
everything is much more open

98
00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:40.159
and now this blue one this one one zero

99
00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.920
now looks like the best packing in 2d in

100
00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.239
fact this is the highest packing in the

101
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.080
body centered system

102
00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.840
right in the face centered it was the

103
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.799
red plane

104
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.480
one one one that had the highest packing

105
00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.760
so we'll come back to this a few times

106
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.760
as we go through

107
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.000
the course
