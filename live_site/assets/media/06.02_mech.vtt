1
00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.640
we're going to be looking at

2
00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:09.200
linear elastic deformation

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.120
and so first what we mean by elastic is

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.040
just that when we load a sample up so

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.759
this is my stress strain

6
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.320
data say take it on that pencil machine

7
00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.000
i could

8
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.880
instead of running this to failure like

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.680
you saw we could stop after some load

10
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.519
some stress value and unload and we

11
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.480
would end up back

12
00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.080
at zero and that's the definition of

13
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.559
elastic we would return

14
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.600
to our original shape there's no

15
00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.600
permanent

16
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.840
deformation in this case we're only

17
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.600
stretching bonds

18
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.399
and in many material systems this

19
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.600
early region this initial region of the

20
00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.039
stress string curve

21
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.879
is also linear so under those conditions

22
00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.719
then we can simply take the slope of

23
00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.399
this linear region

24
00:00:52.719 --> 00:01:00.079
and define that as our elastic modulus

25
00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.920
or young's modulus is also another way

26
00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.680
of referring

27
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.720
to this value okay that typically has

28
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.680
some units of like gigapascals

29
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.280
for metals maybe megapascals for

30
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.799
polymers

31
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.040
and so if we just rearrange this

32
00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.360
equation and we have stress is equal to

33
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.479
this

34
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.280
elastic modulus times strain and we have

35
00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.920
what's called hooke's law

36
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.439
this elastic modulus is a material

37
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.600
property

38
00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.520
right so notice how our definition of

39
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.880
stress and strain allowed us to take the

40
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.600
dimensions

41
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.000
out of the sample and so that we had a

42
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.840
material property that's independent

43
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.880
of sample dimensions if we left it as a

44
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.600
force uh equal to k

45
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.720
times instead of strain now just a

46
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.000
position

47
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.920
a displacement of our sample

48
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.840
we would have what we're used to from

49
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.079
physics for a spring where k would be

50
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.280
the spring stiffness

51
00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.159
but now if i was to increase the

52
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.439
area of my sample then in order to get

53
00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.399
the same displacement

54
00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.560
x i would need to pick up the force

55
00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.040
otherwise the stiffness would go up

56
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.879
this is dependent upon geometry so this

57
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.599
is why we don't use

58
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.280
this form but we put it into stress and

59
00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.319
strain

60
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.000
and use hooke's law for shear we have

61
00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.959
the shear modulus

62
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.400
shear stress and shear strain which we

63
00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.879
just saw recently

64
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.879
defined

65
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:39.440
all right for some materials the

66
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.480
initial region is no longer linear

67
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.120
that's the example of a cast iron so

68
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.200
cast iron if you were to unload at some

69
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.360
point

70
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.200
it will return it may have some

71
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.040
hysteresis

72
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.640
but it will generally follow this curve

73
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.920
and it will return

74
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.319
to zero strain so we will recover all of

75
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.080
the

76
00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.239
strains put into the sample and hence

77
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.080
it's elastic but you can clearly see

78
00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.120
that it's not linear

79
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.800
so we can't define

80
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.080
the elastic modulus like we did

81
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.440
previously because we don't have a

82
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.760
linear region

83
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.519
so what we could do is is either define

84
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.599
something like a secant modulus

85
00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:22.319
so we just draw a straight line from

86
00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.239
the origin here up to some value and we

87
00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.599
pull off the slope of that

88
00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.440
and that would be referred to as a

89
00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.480
secant modulus

90
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.319
at sigma one or we could pick some some

91
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.599
value here sigma 2

92
00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.440
and then we could just define the

93
00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.040
tangent at that point

94
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.879
and that would also and of course be a

95
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.799
stress over strain so this is referred

96
00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.760
to as a tangent modulus

97
00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.440
with these we do have to define these

98
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.000
sigma values of where the measurement

99
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.680
was taken

100
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.879
from all right so that's our example of

101
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.040
cast iron and we'll

102
00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.319
take a look at some real data in a

103
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.519
couple of videos from now

104
00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.280
showing you the actual form of cast iron

105
00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.280
but this is referred to again as

106
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.000
non-linear

107
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.000
elastic

108
00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.120
deformation

109
00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.519
all right so next time we're going to go

110
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.639
ahead and take a look at

111
00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.440
the bonding again that we did in chapter

112
00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.919
2

113
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.520
and we'll see how this is related to the

114
00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.520
elastic modulus
