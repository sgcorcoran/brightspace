1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.399
so welcome back let's go ahead and take

2
00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.839
a look at chapter 2 and atomic bonding

3
00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:09.440
the kinds of questions that we'd like to

4
00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.920
ask today is as we bring

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.280
two atoms or ions together as they

6
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.800
approach each other

7
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.680
and form a bond i'd like to

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.359
quantify the amount of energy that holds

9
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.640
the atoms together that's the bond

10
00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.960
energy

11
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.279
we like to quantify the equilibrium

12
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.119
distance between the atoms

13
00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.720
how close will they sit next to one

14
00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.760
another they get too close they're going

15
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.239
to repel

16
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.239
as they overlap so there's some

17
00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.120
equilibrium distance

18
00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.800
that we want to talk about this will be

19
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.399
obviously related to the radius of the

20
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.079
atoms

21
00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.440
and we like to talk about what kind of

22
00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.079
properties even at this level of bonding

23
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.079
are affected

24
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.719
all right so let's go ahead and look at

25
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.000
the energy

26
00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.760
between two ions that at first very far

27
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.080
apart okay these will have

28
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.159
some attractive energy this is a fairly

29
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.080
long range force

30
00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.560
and so we may have some attractive

31
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.000
energy here between the particles

32
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.240
and as they start to approach each other

33
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.400
this attractive energy will continue to

34
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.640
become more and more negative

35
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.320
it's a larger and larger attractive

36
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.159
energy

37
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.000
okay so you think about the strength of

38
00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.240
the attraction it's the absolute value

39
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.799
that you're thinking of in terms of

40
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.960
energy the energy is going down

41
00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.960
negative are favorable energies

42
00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.759
if these particles get very close

43
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.320
i should say that this separation here

44
00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.200
between the particles

45
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.079
is r that's what we've got plotted here

46
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.360
on our

47
00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:55.280
x part of the axis to get very close

48
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.399
that attractive energy starts to go

49
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.399
become very negative

50
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.399
but they get too close then they start

51
00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.439
overlapping

52
00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.360
and we get a repulsive energy so there

53
00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.879
really are two terms here an attractive

54
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.599
energy

55
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.200
that's this one and a repulsive energy

56
00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.680
which is a short range force

57
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.400
but it increases very fast with this

58
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.599
power n

59
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.720
and n might be for example 9

60
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.319
and you're given your homework problem

61
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.720
and what we can do is we can add these

62
00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.720
two terms and when we add these two

63
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.720
terms we get the red curve that's here

64
00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:39.440
this is our net energy

65
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.360
net energy all right and so

66
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.280
at some point when the repulsive energy

67
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.120
starts to kick in strongly

68
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.879
it will dominate at short distances

69
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.519
that's why this starts to go back up

70
00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.280
become positive our attractive is still

71
00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.000
becoming negative

72
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.840
but the repulsive winds and so the

73
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.640
equilibrium distance

74
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:04.879
is this minimum in the net energy curve

75
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.800
okay so this distance out to the minimum

76
00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.800
is r zero

77
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.519
that's the equilibrium uh separation

78
00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.480
and the value here of this well how deep

79
00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.440
it is

80
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.480
is the bond energy e0 and so that's

81
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.879
where we get

82
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.959
the equilibrium spacing and the bond

83
00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.599
energy

84
00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.560
now the bond energy in your text they

85
00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.239
will

86
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.599
use joules and also evs and so i think

87
00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.519
the problems i've given you we're

88
00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.560
working in evs

89
00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:42.400
and so a typical bond energy

90
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.840
say might be three or four or five

91
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.040
electron volts

92
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.040
depending on the material

93
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.799
all right so that is our energy curve

94
00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.120
now if we wanted to uh come up with say

95
00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:01.280
an equation

96
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.640
for the uh equilibrium spacing or the

97
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.400
bond energy

98
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.799
all we have to notice here is that at

99
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.879
our minimum we've got a slope down here

100
00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:13.040
zero so if we take the derivative

101
00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.760
of the net energy curve with respect to

102
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.919
the radius

103
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.360
and we evaluate that at r0

104
00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.160
this derivative will be equal to zero

105
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.520
okay so i take the derivative i set it

106
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.919
equal to zero

107
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.800
and then i solve for r that r that i'm

108
00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.639
solving for

109
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.000
is r zero the equilibrium spacing

110
00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.400
once i have r zero then i just take that

111
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.479
and put that into

112
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.639
the net energy equation and that'll then

113
00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:48.240
give me the bond energy easier

114
00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.240
so we can do that mathematically

115
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.720
all right for homework you will

116
00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.400
be looking at the attractive and

117
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.400
repulsive energies between two ions

118
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.000
this is this example we have potassium

119
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.800
and chloride i don't remember

120
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.400
i thought what your homework was but

121
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.039
they will give you

122
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.320
the attractive equation the repulsive

123
00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.479
equation

124
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.240
and remember again what we need is just

125
00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.080
the net so we're just simply going to

126
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.160
plot

127
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.240
simply going to add these two we're

128
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.160
going to do this in a plot

129
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.320
so i'll show you what it looks like in

130
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.600
excel

131
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.520
um and then i'll post maybe a video

132
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.199
helping you actually work through excel

133
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.759
if you're having trouble

134
00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.199
but in excel we can go ahead and make a

135
00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.600
column for the attractive

136
00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.080
for the repulsive and then add the two

137
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.800
and then plot all of those versus

138
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.840
the radius r and we'll generate this

139
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.600
curve

140
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.840
that we just saw and then from there we

141
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.080
can read off the bond energy

142
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.080
and the equilibrium's atom spacing

143
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.440
okay so again this is going to remind

144
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.160
you of the equation

145
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.080
this is the data that was given and i

146
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.759
have all of that written over here for

147
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.360
my constants

148
00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.800
in this case i actually went through and

149
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.600
did the derivative

150
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.479
of the equation and found the equations

151
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.400
for e zero and

152
00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.080
r zero so that's what these were for you

153
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.120
don't have to do that

154
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.880
these are calculated

155
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.639
and so what i need to do is just simply

156
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.240
plot this equation so what i'm going to

157
00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:30.720
do is make a column of

158
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.840
r values and the units are in nanometers

159
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.280
so i'll go ahead and we do that and then

160
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.319
i make a column

161
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.319
for the attractive energy piece

162
00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.000
and a column for the repulsive energy

163
00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:43.600
piece

164
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.520
and then i'll go ahead and add those two

165
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.039
for the net energy

166
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.720
and then all i need to do is select

167
00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.520
these columns and

168
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.639
tell excel to go ahead and scatter plot

169
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.479
it

170
00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.000
and i'll get something like this here on

171
00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.360
the right

172
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.440
i know when you first go ahead and do

173
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.319
this in excel what you'll probably find

174
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.560
is that

175
00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:04.720
you don't see actually anything except

176
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.199
for maybe a flat line

177
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.960
and then it looks like your curve kind

178
00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:12.080
of does that

179
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.919
so if you double check on the limits of

180
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.880
the axes here you'll probably find that

181
00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:18.400
they're very very

182
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.199
high so that you can't see as well which

183
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.199
is only

184
00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:22.800
on the order of in this case say almost

185
00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:25.919
0.5 i mean

186
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.000
almost negative 5 evs that's because at

187
00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.240
very close spacings

188
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.720
the repulsive part is very very large so

189
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.280
you notice the size of these numbers

190
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.560
so what you can do is either skip some

191
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.759
of those when you go ahead and do your

192
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.919
plotting

193
00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:41.280
or easier is just go ahead and double

194
00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:43.680
click on your y-axis

195
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.199
and change the scale to something much

196
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.520
more reasonable and you'll get your

197
00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:47.520
curve

198
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.160
now one of the reasons why we're

199
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.479
interested in this bond energy

200
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.639
is that it's related to some properties

201
00:07:56.479 --> 00:08:00.400
of a material and

202
00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:02.479
we'll talk about some of those as we go

203
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.039
on right now i just want to give you one

204
00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:07.520
example which is the melting point

205
00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:09.599
so the bond energy is the energy at

206
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.720
which the atoms are held in position

207
00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:14.960
if you like when we're in a solid

208
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.759
and then we come a liquid we have to

209
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.240
have enough energy to overcome those

210
00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:22.000
that bond energy turn it into a liquid

211
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.240
that's the melting point

212
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.440
and so we we get them this energy by

213
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.479
adding

214
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:31.440
heat or temperature to our sample

215
00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:33.279
and so once the thermal energy right

216
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.159
gets added into the sample and starts to

217
00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.919
become

218
00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:39.039
a significant fraction of this bond

219
00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:42.880
energy then those bonds can be

220
00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:46.640
broken and you end up with with a liquid

221
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.680
and so bottom line here is that as the

222
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.920
bond energy of a material increases

223
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.839
okay that means that the atoms are held

224
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.760
tighter

225
00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:58.160
together they're bound together

226
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.959
the melting point of the material will

227
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.800
also

228
00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:06.480
increase and when we're talking about

229
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:09.519
high bond energies we're talking about

230
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.360
deep wells okay we're taking the

231
00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:14.000
absolute value here

232
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.760
of i'll just put here this kind of

233
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.200
reminder we're taking the absolute value

234
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.320
here of this well

235
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:24.480
so a sample that maybe looks like this

236
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:28.640
this is a and this is sample b right

237
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:31.440
the melting point of sample b

238
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.279
would be greater than the melting point

239
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.560
of sample a

240
00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:39.120
because the bond energy of sample b

241
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.680
is greater than the bond energy of

242
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.519
sample

243
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.519
a has a much deeper well
