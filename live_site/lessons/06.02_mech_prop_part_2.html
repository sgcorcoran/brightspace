            <h2>Stress-Strain data: Beyond the elastic region</h2>
            <figure><img src="../assets/img/stress_strain_Al.jpg"
                    style="float:left; max-width: 350px;margin-right:10px;">
                <figcaption style="text-align:left;">
                    <p><strong>Figure caption: </strong>Stress-strain data for Aluminum 7075-T651. The full curve to
                        failure is labeled "Curve 2" and uses the top axis (0 to 16% strain).
                        The initial data is labeled as "Curve 1" and uses the bottom axis (0 to 1.6% strain). Curve 1
                        allows for a more accurate determination of the elastic modulus and yield strength.</p>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proportional limit:</strong>
                    <p>The value of stress at which the stress-strain curve deviates from Hooke's law i.e. linear
                        elastic behavior. Below this limit, the sample behaves elastic and will return
                        to its original length upon removal of the applied load. A convention for determing the
                        proportional limit was not established but rather a practical limit (the yield strength) was
                        established.
                </li>
                </p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Yield Strength (\( \sigma_y \)):</strong>
                    <p>The 0.002 (or 0.2%) offset yield strength was established as a consistent method to determine the
                        change from elastic to elastic-plastic behavior.
                        Note: The yield stregth is slightly higher than the proportional limit but this difference is
                        typically inconsequential.
                    </p>
                    <p>The method: A line is drawn parallel to the elastic region (slope of the elastic modulus) and
                        then offset by a strain of 0.002. The point where this
                        line and the stress-strain cuve intersect is taken as the yield strength. The method is shown in
                        both the figure above and the below.</p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/yield_strength_curve.png"
                        style="float:left; max-width: 350px;padding-right:1.5rem;">
                    <p>This method also avoids overestimating the yield strength for systems that have an upper and
                        lower yield point (typical of some steels) as shown in the second graph in the figure to the
                        left.
                        Notice that the yield strength falls within the lower region.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../assets/img/stress_strain_necking.png"
                        style="float:left; max-width: 300px;padding-right:1.5rem;">
                </li>
                <li><strong>Tensile Strength:</strong>
                    <p>The maximum stress a material can withstand before
                        breaking. In brittle materials, this value will also be the fracture stress. In ductile
                        materials,
                        the stress will reach a maximum at the tensile strength and then decrease prior to fracture. As
                        shown in the figure, the
                        maximum is where the sample begins to neck. </p>

            <h2>Beyond the tensile test</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="../assets/img/hardness_samples_indented.png"
                        style="float:right; max-width: 250px;margin-right:10px;">
                    <strong>Hardness:</strong>
                    <p>A material’s resistance to deformation, traditionally measured using
                        Rockwell or Brinell hardness machines. For the case of thin films, brittle materials, or
                        multi-phased
                        materials, micro or nano-indentation instruments are a better choice.
                    <p><em> Most modern nano-indentation
                            machinces offer methods of imaging the surface in-situ thus allowing for the exact placement
                            of the indenter tip
                            to test microstructural features. The instruments are also capable of determining the local
                            elastic modulus.</em></p>
                    </p>
                    <p>Hardness tests require very little sample preparation and setup as compared to performing a
                        tensile test. By correlating hardness with either tensile strength or yield strength for a given
                        family of materials, indentation testing becomes a rapid, reliable and low cost method of
                        quality control.
                    </p>
                    <p>The figure below shows the correlation between
                        Brinell hardness and tensile strength for brass, steel, and cast iron.

            <h2>Looking ahead: Toughness</h2>
            <p><strong>Toughness:</strong> a measure of a material's resistance to fracture. For most materials, low temperatures result in a more brittle response. We will discuss this in detail in Modulue 8 on failure mechanisms. The steel used in the titanic became brittle 
                at the temperatures of the sea water. Fracture of the hull was inevitable.

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        A metallurgical analysis of steel taken from the hull of the Titanic's wreckage reveals that it
                        had
                        a
                        high ductile-brittle transition temperature, making it unsuitable for service at low
                        temperatures;
                        at
                        the time of the collision, the temperature of the sea water was -2°C. The analysis also shows,
                        however,
                        that the steel used was probably the best plain carbon ship plate available at the time of the
                        ship's
                        construction.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        The ductile-brittle transition temperature determined at an impact energy of 20 joules is -27°C
                        for
                        ASTM
                        A36, 32°C for the longitudinal specimens made from the Titanic hull plate, and 56°C for the
                        transverse
                        specimens. It is apparent that the steel used for the hull was not suited for service at low
                        temperatures. The seawater temperature at the time of the collision was -2°C.</p>
