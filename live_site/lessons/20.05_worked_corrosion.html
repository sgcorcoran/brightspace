<h4>Key Concept: Corrosion and Degradation Mechanisms</h4>
<p>Corrosion is the deterioration of a metal due to electrochemical reactions with its environment. The corrosion rate (\( R \)) can be calculated using mass loss data:</p>
\[
R = \frac{K \Delta m}{A t \rho}
\]
<p>Where \( K \) is a constant (e.g., \( 8.76 \times 10^4 \) for \( \text{mm/year} \)), \( \Delta m \) is the mass loss, \( A \) is the surface area, \( t \) is time, and \( \rho \) is the density.</p>
<p>Polymer degradation often involves chemical reactions with solvents, leading to changes in molecular weight and mechanical properties.</p>

<h3>Expanded Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Determine the corrosion rate and degradation effects for:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Iron sample exposed to an acidic environment for \( 30 \, \text{days} \). The initial mass is \( 200 \, \text{g} \), and the mass loss is \( 5 \, \text{g} \). The surface area is \( 0.02 \, \text{m}^2 \), and the density of Iron is \( 7.87 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \).</li>
<li>A Polycarbonate sample immersed in Acetone for \( 10 \, \text{days} \). The sample's mass decreases by \( 2 \, \text{\%} \) due to solvent attack, affecting its tensile strength. The initial tensile strength is \( 70 \, \text{MPa} \).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<h4>Step 1: Calculate the Corrosion Rate for Iron</h4>
<p>Convert the mass loss to \( \text{g/cm}^3 \):</p>
\[
\Delta m = 5 \, \text{g}, \quad \rho = 7.87 \, \text{g/cm}^3
\]

<p>Calculate the corrosion rate using the formula:</p>
\[
R = \frac{8.76 \times 10^4 \times 5}{0.02 \times 30 \times 7.87} = 93.1 \, \text{mm/year}
\]

<h4>Step 2: Analyze Degradation of Polycarbonate</h4>
<p>The mass loss of \( 2 \, \text{\%} \) indicates chemical degradation. Assume a linear relationship between mass loss and tensile strength reduction:</p>
\[
\text{New Tensile Strength} = 70 \, \text{MPa} \times (1 - 0.02) = 68.6 \, \text{MPa}
\]

<h4>Step 3: Interpretation of Results</h4>
<p>The corrosion rate of Iron is relatively high, indicating significant material loss in the acidic environment. The reduction in tensile strength of Polycarbonate suggests a loss in mechanical integrity due to solvent exposure.</p>
